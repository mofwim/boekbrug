  // this feature exists to stop holds a stolen PASSWORD, so he holds a valid session cookie at
  // aal1, and he does not need a screen —
  //     curl -H 'Cookie: sb-…' -X POST /api/invoice/send
  // issues an invoice in the owner's name and in his doorlopende nummerreeks, which cannot be
  // withdrawn afterwards. That is precisely the harm the enrolment screen promises to prevent, so
  // the API has to be behind the same step as the screens.

  // WHY THIS APPLIES THE RULE AND DOES NOT RESTATE IT. A wrong branch in these few lines fails
  // nothing that runs in CI: it type-checks, it builds, and the smoke test never logs in. What it
  // does instead is send EVERY page of EVERY user to /verificatie — including the settings screen
  // that would switch two-step back off, and the sign-out that would end the session. That is an
  // entrepreneur locked out of seven years of records he is legally obliged to keep, by us, with no
  // door left open. So the decision lives in src/lib/mfa.ts, in a function with no I/O and a test
  // per branch (the exemptions for /verificatie, /login and /uitloggen are precisely what stop this
  // redirect from looping), and this file only fetches the two levels and does what it says. If the
  // rule has to change, change it there — where it is tested — and not here.
