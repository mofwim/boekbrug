// src/content/legal/pricing-commitments.test.ts
// [KANTOOR-STAFFEL] What the Terms promise about price, guarded the way exit-commitments.test.ts
// guards the shutdown clause — and for the same reason.
//
// These clauses were written at zero paying customers. That is the only moment they are free to
// write, and precisely what makes them easy to lose later: a future rewrite of §5.5 or §5.8 that
// narrows them produces no error, no failing build, and no visible change until the day an office
// asks whether its limit can be taken away. By then the answer cannot be given any more.
//
// Two distinct things are asserted here:
//   1. the grandfathering promise of §5.5.1 still says what it says;
//   2. the §5.8 price table still matches src/lib/accountant-pricing.ts.
//
// (2) is the regression that already happened once in this repo. In July 2026 the published Terms
// quoted plans of € 25 and € 45 while the database knew a different four-tier model — two copies
// of one fact, drifting apart unnoticed. The table is generated now, and this test is what proves
// the generated version is the one that reaches /voorwaarden.
//
// Asserts the RENDERED document, like company.test.ts and exit-commitments.test.ts.
