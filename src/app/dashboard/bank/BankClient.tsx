                  Er waren er twee: koppel een BESTAND, of negeer de regel. Beide gaan uit van de
                  aanname dat één betaling bij één factuur hoort. Een groothandel schrijft één bedrag
                  af voor een week leveringen; een klant maakt één som over voor vier facturen en
                  houdt op de laatste twaalf euro in; een leverancier trekt eerst een creditnota van
                  de partij af. Niets daarvan paste, dus werd het opgelost door iets anders in te
                  vullen dan wat er gebeurde — of door de regel te negeren, waarna hij in geen enkel
                  cijfer meer voorkomt.

                  Dit scherm laat de eigenaar de facturen die er AL staan zelf aanwijzen, met een
                  bedrag per factuur. Bewust een aparte pagina: er is ruimte nodig voor een lijst,
                  een bedragveld per regel en één getal dat bovenaan meeloopt — "nog te verdelen" —
                  en dat past niet in een kaartje van 300 pixels. */}
