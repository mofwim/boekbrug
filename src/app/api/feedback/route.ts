// src/app/api/feedback/route.ts
// [FEEDBACK] POST — an owner reports a problem, optionally with a screenshot.
//
// THE ORDER OF WRITES IS THE DESIGN.
// The ROW is the truth; the e-mail is a notification. So: store the row, then send. A report that
// existed only as an e-mail would be lost the moment Resend rejected it or the key was absent —
// and losing a message about a problem, silently, is the exact failure this feature exists to end.
// The image is uploaded first because its path belongs in the row, but a failed upload never
// costs the words: the report is stored without the picture and the answer says so.
//
// AND THE ANSWER IS NEVER A POLITE LIE.
// "Bedankt voor je melding" over a failed insert is worse than an error: the owner stops worrying
// about a problem nobody will ever see. A failed store is a refusal, in words, with the message
// still in the box so it can be sent again.

  // COMPILER checks these five column names — which is the only check that was ever going to catch
