/**
 * [DOC-VERSE-LINK] An answer the CALLER can read.
 *
 * This route serves two kinds of caller. The sheet fetches it and reads JSON. With ?open=1 the
 * browser is navigating to it directly, and a JSON object in a tab is what the owner was already
 * shown once — `{"statusCode":"400","error":"InvalidJWT"…}` — which tells them nothing and looks
 * like the app broke. Same failure, two audiences, so: a sentence for the tab, JSON for the fetch.
 *
 * Deliberately plain: no styling, no link back. This is the last thing standing when the file
 * cannot be reached, and every dependency it takes on is another way for it to fail too.
