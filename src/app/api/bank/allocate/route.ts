// src/app/api/bank/allocate/route.ts
// [BETAALPLAN] One bank line, several invoices, an amount per invoice — booked as ONE decision.
//
// ── WHY THIS ROUTE EXISTS NEXT TO /api/bank/confirm ──
// confirm books ONE invoice. A batch had to be N calls to it, and N independent calls cannot see
// the thing that actually matters: their sum. Each of three calls booking €3.000, €2.000 and
// €1.200 against a €5.000 debit is individually reasonable and collectively books €1.200 that never
// left the account. Nothing downstream — the P&L, the BTW return, the accountant's package — can
// tell that it did not.
//
// So the plan is validated as a WHOLE first (payment-plan.ts, 22 tests), and only then applied.
//
// That pre-flight check is NOT the last line of defence, and saying so matters. allocate_bank_payment
// re-reads Σ amount_applied of the line's other links UNDER the transaction lock and refuses there
// too — atomically, which nothing in TypeScript can be. The check here exists to tell the owner
// what is wrong BEFORE half a batch is booked; the database is what makes it true.
//
// ── WHAT "ATOMIC" MEANS HERE, HONESTLY ──
// Every line goes through allocate_bank_payment — one call per line, because that function is where
// the per-invoice locking, the amount_paid recompute and the 'verwerkt' guard live, and
// reimplementing that here would be a second source of truth for money.
//
// That means the loop is not one database transaction. The whole-plan validation runs BEFORE any
// write precisely because of that: by the time the first line is applied, the plan is known to fit
// the payment and every invoice. What can still fail mid-way is a concurrent booking claiming the
// same transaction — and then this route stops, reports exactly which lines landed, and leaves the
// rest alone. It never retries and never partially guesses: a half-applied batch that SAYS it is
// half-applied is recoverable, and one that claims success is not.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DECIDE ──
// The leftover. Money this plan does not explain is reported and left where it is. It could be a
// bank charge, an early-payment discount, or an invoice that was never imported, and those have
// different right answers. Naming the amount and leaving the reason to the owner is the honest
// shape; guessing it writes a number into an administration with our name on it.
