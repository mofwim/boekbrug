// src/app/api/bank/confirm/route.ts
// [BOEK-016] Confirm a bank match (phase 4). The HUMAN confirms; this executes.
// [BANK-MULTI-CONFIRM] One transaction can cover SEVERAL invoices (a supplier
//   combines two invoices in one transfer; a customer pays a gebundeld
//   betaalverzoek). Confirming ONE invoice must NOT hide the transaction while
//   money of it still belongs to another invoice. So:
//     - We always pay + link the confirmed invoice (as before).
//     - Each booking may only spend what the payment still HAS: the euros this
//       bank line already put on other invoices (bank_tx_invoices.amount_applied)
//       are subtracted first.
//     - We only flip the transaction to 'matched' when every euro of it sits on an
//       invoice. Otherwise it stays 'pending' so it remains in "Te bevestigen"
//       with the rest of the money still assignable.
// [BANK-ONE-PAYMENT-MANY-INVOICES] That is arithmetic, deliberately. The old rule
//   counted number-shaped tokens in the reference to decide "single or batch?" and
//   then checked that every token had a paid invoice. It was wrong in both
//   directions — a customer number in the description made a €500 instalment book
//   as a full settlement, and a bundle whose numbers the extractor had mutilated
//   ("2026-045, 2026-046" is stored as "045, 046") let one invoice swallow a
//   payment meant for two. The amounts answer both questions without guessing.
//
// Writes two things, in legal-priority order:
//   (a) invoice → status 'paid' + payment_method 'bank' + marked_paid_at   (reuses B.3 semantics)
//   (b) bank_transactions → status 'matched' + invoice_id                  (only when allCovered)
//
// Atomicity: Supabase has no REST transaction. We write (a) first (legally the important one).
// If (b) fails, we DO NOT roll back (a) — same philosophy as B.11 ("email failure does not
// block invoice completion"). The only possible half-state is invoice=paid + tx=pending, which
// is benign and self-healing (re-running /api/bank/match surfaces it again). A true-atomic RPC
// can replace the two writes later if desired (no rollback gaps in Dutch tax law).
//
// ⚠️ CRITICAL: the invoice UPDATE uses the SESSION client, never the pipeline (service_role).
//    The verwerkt guard trigger early-returns when auth.uid() IS NULL, so a service_role write
//    would SILENTLY BYPASS the B.4 Conflict Guard. The session client sets auth.uid() → guard fires.

  // code: from the moment bank_confirm_atomic.sql was applied, a payment naming an invoice the
  // administration does not hold was booked in full onto the one invoice it did hold — the ATAPACK
