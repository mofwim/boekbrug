// [JAARSTAND] Which quarters of a year are filed. One SELECT, no recompute.

// GET /api/btw/filed?year=2026 → { ok: true, filed: [1, 3] }
//
// Deliberately NOT part of /api/btw/file: that route answers about ONE quarter and recomputes the
// live figures to report divergence against the frozen snapshot. Calling it four times to draw a
// year strip would run the reconcile engine four times for an answer that is a list of integers.
//
// Reads through the SESSION client, so RLS scopes it to the caller — the year strip is the owner's
// own, and this route never takes a user id from the request.
