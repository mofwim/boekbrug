// src/app/api/invoice/pay-toggle/route.ts
// [PAY-TOGGLE] The server-authoritative "mark paid" / "undo paid" for a manually-handled invoice
// (the Crediteuren + Facturen "Betaald" toggle). It replaces the old direct client-side write for
// two audited-truth reasons the audit surfaced:
//   [16] every money mutation must be AUDITED — the client write left no audit row.
//   [15] an UNDO of a bank-matched invoice must DETACH its bank transaction — the client toggle
//        undid the invoice side only, stranding the tx as 'matched' (invoice payable a second time,
//        the payment unreachable to re-link). Here the undo runs the same reversal the /bank/unlink
//        path does: detach the tx → pending, clear the join rows, recompute amount_paid.
// The invoice status write uses the SESSION client so the B.4 'verwerkt' trigger fires with a real
// auth.uid(); bank/join writes + audit use the service-role pipeline.

  //     The old clearPaymentLinks(tx) wiped the whole batch's reversal index and flipped a
  //     still-partially-valid payment back to 'pending'.

  //     snapshotted WITH amount_applied and restored, tx status/invoice_id restored, and
  //     amount_paid recomputed — never "links destroyed but invoice still paid".

  // inflate amount_paid. Keyed on the primary key instead, the restore is exact for both

  // [UNDO-READ-CLOSED] Every read below is FAIL-CLOSED, and that is the whole point of doing them
  // first. They all ran with the error dropped, so a transient failure came back as an empty
  // snapshot — which does not mean "no links", it means "we do not know the links". The undo then
  // walked on anyway and did exactly the damage this route exists to prevent:
  //   · the delete further down runs unconditionally, so the join rows go — while the snapshot
  //     that the rollback restores from is empty, making the rollback a no-op;
  //   · a tx linked ONLY through the join table never reaches linkedTxIds, so it stays 'matched'
  //     with nothing pointing at it while the invoice returns to 'received' — the invoice is
  //     payable a second time and its payment is unreachable to re-link. That is defect [15] in
  //     this file's own header, reintroduced by a dropped error;
  //   · a failed `otherRows` read reads as "not a batch", so a tx that also pays OTHER invoices

  // [UNDO-EIGEN-WERK] A rollback may only undo the writes THIS request actually made.
  //
  // The rollback used to restore from `myLinks` and `txPrev` — the snapshot taken at the START of
  // the request. Under two concurrent undos on the same invoice that resurrects a payment the owner
  // deliberately removed, through the branch that exists precisely FOR a lost race:
  //
  //   A snapshots [L1]; B snapshots [L1].
  //   A detaches, deletes L1, recomputes, flips the invoice paid → received. Done, correct.
  //   B detaches (already detached), deletes (0 rows — L1 is gone), recomputes (0), and then its
  //   invoice UPDATE carries `.eq('status','paid')`, which now matches nothing.
  //   B falls into the honest-zero-row branch, calls this rollback, and upserts L1 back FROM ITS
  //   OWN STALE SNAPSHOT — with the bank transaction restored to 'matched' pointing at the invoice.
  //
  // The invoice ends 'received' with amount_paid standing on a link the owner deleted, and the
  // transaction is 'matched' again so the matcher will never resurface it. Two taps on two devices
  // is enough; the undo path has no idempotency key, unlike the pay path.
  //
  // So the rollback restores `deletedLinks` — what the DELETE reported it actually removed — and
  // reverts only transactions this request actually wrote. B deleted nothing, so B restores

  // failed on the invoice write puts them back, which is what this rollback is for.
