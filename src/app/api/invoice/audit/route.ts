// src/app/api/invoice/audit/route.ts
// [NAREKENEN] "Reken mijn boeken na" — re-check the amounts that are ALREADY booked against the
// documents they came from.
//
// ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──
// [GEGROND] gave every amount an independent witness: for a text PDF, either the number occurs in
// the document's own characters or it does not. But it runs at IMPORT, so it says nothing about the
// invoices that were already in the books — which is precisely the set an owner doubts. Being told
// "everything from today onwards is verified" does not answer "is what is in there now right?".
//
// ── IT WRITES EVIDENCE. IT NEVER WRITES A FIGURE. ──
// Not one amount, date, status or BTW field is touched, and that is not caution for its own sake.
// An audit that can also "fix" what it finds is an audit whose results cannot be checked; and on a
// booked invoice a silent correction moves a figure that may already sit in a filed aangifte. The
// owner is told what was found. What to do about it is theirs, through the correction paths that
// already exist (Bedragen corrigeren, Opnieuw inlezen).
//
// The only write is field_confidence._grounding — the verdict itself — so a second run does not
// have to redo the work, and so the verify screen can show the result on the row.
//
// ── FREE, AND HONEST ABOUT WHAT IT SKIPPED ──
// The mechanical witness needs characters, so this reads the stored PDF's text layer: no AI call, no
// cost, nothing to rate-limit but the storage reads. A photographed receipt has no text, and the OCR
// witness costs an API call per document — running that across a whole administration would be a
// bill nobody asked for. Those come back UNCHECKED and the report says so out loud, because
// "everything checks out" while silently skipping the photographs is a claim about documents nobody
// opened.
