// src/app/api/invoice/[id]/document/route.ts
// [ORIGINEEL] Give an invoice that has no original document one.
//
// ── THE LOOP THAT WAS BROKEN AT THE CLIENT'S END ──
// The readiness board counts verified invoices with no stored PDF and says so: "3 facturen missen
// het originele document — de boekhouder kan deze niet controleren". The accountant's "opvragen"
// flow turns that same item into a specific request, by invoice number, sent to the client.
//
// And then the client could do nothing. document_id is written at CREATION — by intake, by the
// e-mail door, by the bank attach — and by NOTHING afterwards. There was no route, no button, no
// path of any kind that could attach a file to an invoice that already existed. The one readiness
// item in the whole report that carried no fix link was this one, and the missing link was not an
// oversight in the report: there was nowhere for it to point.
//
// So an invoice typed in by hand, or one whose upload failed halfway, was permanently unprovable.
// The accountant asks every quarter, the client cannot answer, and neither of them can tell that
// the app is the reason.
//
// ── EVIDENCE ONLY. NEVER A FIGURE. ──
// This is the entire safety contract, and it is what separates this from every other upload door.
// The other doors READ the file with the AI extractor and create an invoice from what they find.
// This one does not read it at all. The invoice already exists; its amounts, its date, its BTW
// were verified by the owner (or by the accountant, who may already have processed it). Re-reading
// the document here would let a misread quietly overwrite a confirmed figure — the most expensive
// possible way to fix a missing attachment.
//
// It writes exactly two things: a documents row, and invoices.document_id/pdf_url. Nothing else on
// the invoice is touched. That is also why the accountant's 'verwerkt' lock does NOT block it: the
// lock exists to protect the figures they booked, and this changes none of them. Refusing here
// would refuse precisely the invoice the accountant asked about — the whole point of the feature.
//
// Replacing an existing document is a different act with a different risk (it discards evidence),
// so it is refused: this route only ever fills an empty slot.
