// [BULK-PDF] Take several invoices away at once, as pdf.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING ──
//
// Reported plainly: "I want to download invoices as pdf, but I have to open each one, open the pdf
// and press save — far too many steps." Both lists already let the owner select several rows; what
// they could not do afterwards is take them.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE THAT DECIDES EVERYTHING HERE ──
//
// A SENT invoice already has a pdf, and that stored file is the document the customer received. It
// is the evidence. Re-drawing it from the lines would produce a document that merely LOOKS like
// the one that was sent — a logo since changed, an address since corrected, a template since
// improved — and hand it over as if it were the original. So the stored file wins whenever there
// is one, and rendering is only ever the fallback for an invoice that never had one (a draft, or
// one created before the pdf was stored).
//
// That is also why nothing here writes: a download may not repair, backfill or normalise anything.
// It answers with what exists.
//
// ── PURCHASE INVOICES TOO ──
//
// direction 'incoming' works the same way and is even simpler: the supplier's own document is the
// only truth there, so a missing one is reported rather than invented. We never draw a supplier's
// invoice ourselves — that would be manufacturing someone else's paperwork.
