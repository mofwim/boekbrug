// [AUTO-INCASSO] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/auto-incasso-gates.test.ts
//
// WHY THESE ARE SOURCE-LEVEL GATES
//
// This feature books payments nobody watched happen. What makes that acceptable is not the
// decision function — that one has its own tests and its own negative controls — but four pieces
// of wiring around it, every one of which fails SILENTLY when it breaks:
//
//   · the booking goes through apply_manual_payment. A direct `.update({ status: 'paid' })` is one
//     line shorter, reads perfectly, and breaks the invariant this whole app is built on
//     (invoices.amount_paid = SUM(bank_tx_invoices.amount_applied)). Nothing on any screen turns
//     red; the number simply stops adding up, months later, in an accountant's export;
//   · it books on the VERVALDATUM. `amsterdamToday()` is the obvious thing to reach for and is
//     wrong in one specific way: under the kasstelsel the payment date picks the BTW-kwartaal, so
//     a collection that ran on 30 June booked "today" lands in Q3 instead of Q2;
//   · the QR pay sheet is closed on an incasso row. That button pre-fills the supplier's IBAN and
//     amount in the owner's banking app — on an already-collected invoice it is a second payment,
//     one tap away, with no warning anywhere. It sits in the EXPANDED card, which a static render
//     never opens, so the render gate cannot see it;
//   · the incasso pass runs from the hourly cron. Without that, the switch works exactly once (in
//     the request that flips it) and every invoice after that stays open forever — a feature that
//     appears to work on the day you turn it on and quietly does nothing from then on.
