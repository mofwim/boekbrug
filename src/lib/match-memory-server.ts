// src/lib/match-memory-server.ts
// [GEHEUGEN] The read half of the confirmed-match memory. Fetches, decides nothing.
//
// What the memory MEANS, and the rule that keeps a single mistaken confirmation from doing harm,
// is argued in match-memory.ts. This file only assembles the rows it is built from:
//
//     bank_tx_invoices        the confirmation itself — this transaction settled this invoice
//       → bank_transactions   what the bank called the counterparty, and from which account
//       → invoices            which party that invoice bills
//
// Three reads, all id-keyed, all chunked and paged the way every other id-keyed read here is: a
// silent truncation would drop confirmations, which reads as "this counterparty is new" — a wrong
// answer that looks exactly like a right one.
//
// Best-effort by the same contract as the supplier registry: a failed or empty read yields an
// empty memory, and an empty memory leaves the matcher reasoning purely from the payment, exactly
// as it did before this existed. The degradation removes evidence and never invents it.
