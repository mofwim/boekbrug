// [EMAIL-SYNC] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/email-sync-gates.test.ts
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
//
// The email sync is the door most invoices actually arrive through, and it is the one door with
// nobody standing at it. Its gates live inside one very large async function that reaches Gmail,
// Outlook, Storage, the AI and four tables, so no unit test calls them — which is why two of them
// had been quietly wrong for as long as they had existed.
//
// Both were invisible for the same reason: they fail by returning a normal-looking value.
//
//   · The byte-hash gate read `const { data: existingByHash } = …`. supabase-js answers a failed
//     read with { data: null, error }, and null here means "this file is new". A read that could
//     not run therefore imported the identical file again — same cost, same voorbelasting, twice —
//     with nothing saying so. The manual doors have a human who at least sees a confusing message;
//     here there is no one.
//
//   · When the (user_id, content_hash) unique index then refused the second document row, the
//     generic error branch deleted the storage object, set document_id and pdf_url to null, and
//     saved the invoice anyway. The closing package resolves the evidence PDF through
//     invoices.document_id, so that is a cost in the books with no paper behind it — the state
//     /api/intake calls unacceptable in its own [R1] note, produced by the door next to it.
//
// A source-level gate is the honest instrument for code a unit test cannot reach. It does not
// prove the sync behaves; it proves the specific lines that make it honest are still there, so a
// refactor cannot silently undo them the way one already undid the [IBAN-CHECK-HONEST] throw.
