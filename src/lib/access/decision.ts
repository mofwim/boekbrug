// [EEN-POORT] One authorization decision. Pure, no I/O, no clock of its own.

//
// ── THE ONE PROPERTY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// There must not be two different answers in BoekBrug to the question: may this actor perform
// this operation? Today there are eight places that answer it. This module does not delete any of
// them — RLS, the caller guards inside the money functions, requireOwner(), the accountant
// mandate — they are ENFORCEMENT LAYERS and defence in depth is deliberate. What it replaces is
// the eight separate POLICIES behind them with one.
//
//   One policy definition. Several enforcement layers.
//   Not: several policy definitions.
//
// ── A BOOLEAN IS NOT A DECISION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `false` tells a screen nothing, tells an audit row nothing, and tells the owner nothing. Every
// refusal here carries a reason code, and the reason code is the same vocabulary the rest of the
// app refuses in (contracts/reason-codes.ts). That is what lets a workflow guard, a Today item,
// an exception list and a support question all read the same answer.
//
// What it must NOT carry is anything the refused actor should not learn. A DENY says which
// permission was missing; it never says whether the resource exists or whose it is.
//
// ── FAIL CLOSED, AND SAY SO IN CODE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every path that cannot PROVE the answer returns deny. No session, no membership, an unknown
// permission, a role we do not recognise, a resource with no owner: all deny. An authorization
// error must never become access, so there is no branch here that ends in allow by omission.
