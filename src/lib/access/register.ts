//
// ── WHY A REGISTER AND NOT JUST A NEW ENGINE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The value of one authorization model does not begin when it is written. It begins when the old
// paths are measured and closed. A canonical resolver standing beside eight legacy mechanisms is
// a ninth mechanism, and "temporarily" is how four of them stayed for a year.
//
// So this file does the unglamorous half: it names every mechanism, says what it IS, and pins a
// CEILING on how far it reaches. The gate measures the repository and fails when a ceiling is
// exceeded. Ceilings only ever come down — that is the whole mechanism, and it is the same
// ratchet [RUSTIG] uses on words on screen.
//
// ── THE FOUR CLASSES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   canonical    — this is the answer. New code uses it; its reach may grow.
//   transitional — correct, in the right place, and destined to be folded in. Reach may not grow.
//   legacy       — works, but is a second answer to a question that has one. Reach must shrink.
//   forbidden    — must not exist. Ceiling zero.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT LEGACY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// RLS, and the caller guards inside the SECURITY DEFINER money functions, are NOT duplicate
// policies. They are ENFORCEMENT LAYERS under the same policy, and defence in depth is the
// design: the application decides whether an actor may perform an action, the database decides
// whether a connection may touch a tenant's rows. Removing either would not simplify anything;
// it would remove a floor. They are counted here so their reach is visible, and their class says
// so.
