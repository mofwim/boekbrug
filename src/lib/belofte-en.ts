// [BELOFTE-EN] The promise in English — a translation of belofte.ts, nothing more.
//
// WHY A SECOND FILE AND NOT A TRANSLATION LAYER
// This product has one Dutch homepage and one English one. A full i18n framework for two pages
// is more machinery than content, and the machinery is the part that rots. Two files that must
// move together, with the rule written down, is smaller and harder to get wrong.
//
// THE RULE: THIS FILE IS A TRANSLATION, NEVER A SECOND OPINION.
// Every string below has a counterpart in belofte.ts. Change one and change the other, in the
// same commit. If the English ever says something the Dutch does not, the English is wrong —
// even if it reads better. The Dutch is what the terms, the app and the accountant see.
//
// AND IT MUST NOT PROMISE MORE. BELOFTE_GERUST is a contractual line (voorwaarden §5.2): free,
// no expiring trial, never auto-charged. Its English twin carries the same three, no softer and
// no wider. A marketing sentence that outruns the contract is the one thing this product does
// not do — see the honesty rule at the top of prijzen/page.tsx.
//
// SIMPLE ENGLISH ON PURPOSE. Many entrepreneurs in the Netherlands do not have Dutch OR English
// as a first language; they must still file a Dutch BTW return. Short sentences and common words
// are not a style choice here, they are the point.
