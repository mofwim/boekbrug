// [COST-GUARD] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/ai-budget.test.ts
//
// The arithmetic of the fuse, without a database.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS AND NOT OTHERS
//
// The fuse is global: one number, shared by every user of the app. That makes its arithmetic
// unusually consequential in ONE direction — an estimate that is 3× too high does not cost money,
// it costs everyone else their automatic reading for the rest of the day. That is exactly what
// happened: €5 blew at ~260 documents while real spend was under €2, because the reservation
// charged max_tokens and the cache-write rate on every call.
//
// So the properties worth pinning are about the CORRECTION, and about the directions in which it
// must refuse to correct:
//
//   1. The refund is real and large. A settled batch call costs a fraction of its reservation.
//   2. A dearer-than-estimated call is CHARGED. A settlement that only ever refunds is a discount.
//   3. An unreadable usage block settles NOTHING. Never talk a fuse down from a response you could
//      not read — that is the one direction where being wrong ends in a bill.
//   4. A reservation that was never recorded is never settled. Fail-open on the guard must not
//      turn into subtracting money nobody charged.
//   5. The floor: no settlement can be constructed that drives a day negative on its own. (The
//      database clamps too — GREATEST(...,0) in ai_budget_settle.sql — but a fuse deserves both.)
