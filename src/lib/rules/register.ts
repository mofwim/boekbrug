// src/lib/rules/register.ts
// [REGEL-DEUR] Which doors must ask which rule — derived from the repository, never listed.
// Pure data + one pure derivation. No I/O beyond reading source files in the gate.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO BE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Rules survey measured the gap precisely, and it was not a shortage of rules: 111 of the
// 139 modules that carry a decision are already pure, and 151 of the 670 route refusals already
// delegate to one. Two things were missing, and only two:
//
//   · a rule cannot say whether it BLOCKS or merely warns — the caller decides, so one shape
//     becomes a 409 in a route and a grey button in a screen;
//   · nothing records WHICH DOORS must ask a given rule, so a rule can be written, gated, and
//     reach no call site at all. factuurstaat.ts and autonomy-scope.ts are both in that state
//     today: pure, argued, gated, and imported by nothing in the product.
//
// This file closes the second one. It is not a rule engine and it holds no business logic: every
// rule named here already exists, in the module named as its owner.
//
// ── THE ONE DESIGN CONSTRAINT, AND WHY IT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious shape is `doorsThatMustAsk: ["api/email/upload", "api/intake", …]`. That replaces
// one problem — a rule with no caller — with a worse one: a door name spelled wrong in a
// register, which reads exactly like a door that is covered. The list would then be the thing
// everyone trusts and nobody re-derives.
//
// So a door set is a QUERY, never a list. `protects` says what the rule stands in front of —
// "a write into invoices whose body sets direction:'incoming'" — and the gate runs that query
// over src/ on every run. A new door that performs the write is IN the set the moment it is
// written, whether or not anyone remembered this file.
//
// `excused` is the only list, and it is the opposite of a door list: it names the files the
// query FINDS and that legitimately do not ask, each with the reason. The gate checks it in both
// directions, so an excuse for a file that no longer performs the write goes red rather than
// standing next to reasons that still hold.
//
// This is not a new mechanism. [EEN-SCHRIJFPAD] has worked exactly this way since Phase 0 — it
// walks src/, finds every write of the paid state, and compares that derived set against
// BETAALD_SCHRIJVERS. What this file adds is that the shape stops being one gate's private idea.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER ──────────────────────────
//
// Five ways a door/rule relationship can be false, and how far this reaches:
//
//   1. the door path does not resolve ............ proved (the query only yields real files)
//   2. the door does not call the rule ........... proved (needle over comment-stripped source)
//   3. it calls a different helper instead ....... proved (the needle names the owner's export)
//   4. the door moved or was renamed ............. proved (the query re-runs; excuses go stale)
//   5. the call sits in unreachable code ......... NOT fully provable without a parser
//
// For (5) this reaches two things and no further: the call is not inside a comment, and — where
// the rule IS an order — it appears BEFORE the write it guards. A call in a branch that can
// never run would still pass. That is a real limit and it is written down here, because a
// register that overclaims its own coverage is the failure this whole layer exists to end.
