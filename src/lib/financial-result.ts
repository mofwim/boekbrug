// [RESULT] Phase 3 — the true quarterly result across ALL channels: sales invoices,
// purchase invoices/receipts, owner-categorized bank lines, and the cash book. Pure,
// fully testable (run: npx tsx src/lib/financial-result.test.ts).
//
// The whole point is HONESTY, so double-counting is the enemy. The de-dup rules:
//   - A bank line with invoice_id set is the PAYMENT of an invoice already counted →
//     excluded. (Reconciliation, not a second cost/revenue.)
//   - A bank line with no confirmed category is NOT guessed into a money total.
//   - Transfers / prive / tax / fee never touch revenue or cost.
//
// BTW stays documented: verschuldigde BTW from sales invoices + cash sales where the
// owner set a rate; voorbelasting ONLY from purchase invoices/receipts (a bare bank or
// cash line has no valid BTW document, so none is claimed). Cash sales recorded without
// a rate are surfaced separately (cashOmzetZonderBtw) rather than silently guessed.
