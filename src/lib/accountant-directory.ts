// src/lib/accountant-directory.ts
// [KANTOORGIDS] The public list of offices that work with BoekBrug. Pure — no I/O, no clock.
// Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/accountant-directory.test.ts
//
// The string VALUES here are Dutch because they are rendered verbatim; the arrangement in
// office-offer.ts, and for the same reason: this is copy, not code.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [GEEN-PROVISIE] settled that BoekBrug does not pay an office for bringing a client. This is the
// other direction, and it is the reason that refusal is not simply a "no": an owner who signs up
// without a boekhouder is a lead the office would otherwise have paid for, and we have those
// every week. A referral running BOTH ways is worth more to an office than a share of a
// subscription, and it costs no part of the price a client pays.
//
// ── THE RULE THAT MAKES THE LIST WORTH BEING ON ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The order is not for sale, and cannot become so by accident. `sortForOwner` orders by exactly
// two things — offices that say they have room come before offices that do not, and within that
// the order is stable by name. There is no score, no tier and no paid position, and nothing here
// reads a payment status: `DirectoryEntry` has no field to read. A directory whose first three
// rows can be bought is an advertisement, and everybody can tell the difference; the moment it
// becomes one, the refusal to pay for recommendations becomes a technicality.
//
// ── PUBLISHED IS AN ACT, NOT A DEFAULT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing appears here because an office signed up. An office types what it wants shown and turns
// it on, and can turn it off again — its name, its town and its e-mail are its own to publish,
// and an accountant discovering their own listing they never made is an accountant who leaves.

// The language list is NOT a list of its own. It is the set of languages BoekBrug itself speaks
// (src/lib/i18n/locale.ts), so the gids can never offer a language the product cannot serve a
// client in, and can never fall behind one it learns.
import { LOCALES, type Locale } from "./i18n/locale";

/**
 * [KANTOORGIDS-TAAL] The languages an office may say it works in — a CLOSED set, and that is the
 * whole reason a filter is possible.
 *
 * Free text cannot be filtered: "Arabisch", "arabic", "العربية" and "AR" are four values for one
 * language, and an owner who ticks Arabisch would miss three quarters of the offices that speak it.
 * A directory that cannot answer "who understands me?" is a list you scroll, and scrolling is what
 * the owner was already doing on Google.
 *
 * What this set is NOT: every language on earth. An office that also speaks Pools cannot say so
 * here, and that is a real limit rather than an oversight — it can put it in its specialisms,
 * which are free text precisely because they are not filtered. The day BoekBrug speaks Polish,
 * this set gains it for free, because it is the same list.
