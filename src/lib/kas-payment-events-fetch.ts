// src/lib/kas-payment-events-fetch.ts
// [KASSTELSEL] The I/O that gathers an owner's invoice SETTLEMENTS (which day money moved, and how
// much) and hands them to the pure buildQuarterSettlements. Kept out of kas-payment-events.ts so
// that module stays a pure, exhaustively-tested arithmetic core.
//
// Date resolution per invoice, most-authoritative first (verified by the design's payment-date map):
//   1. bank_tx_invoices.amount_applied ⨝ bank_transactions.date  — real settlement date, PER
//      installment (collision-free; a batch payment dates each linked invoice by its own tx).
//   2. invoices.payment_date            — a cash/manual pay the owner recorded (exact date).
//   3. invoices.marked_paid_at          — the human-confirm moment (an ESTIMATE of the pay date).
//   4. none                             — paid but undated → surfaced (undatedPaidCount), never dropped.
//
// The engine never trusts a stored sign: the grouper signs each magnitude from the invoice header,
// so a creditnota (negative header) nets correctly.

 * to factuur, never a wrong number" — is true of exactly one failure and was applied to all of
 * them. A missing COLUMN really does mean "this owner has made no election yet", and factuur is
 * then the right answer. A read that FAILED means we do not know the election, and answering
 * factuur for a kasstelsel owner is not a smaller answer, it is a different declaration:
 *
 *   · BTW is computed on the invoice date instead of the payment date, so unpaid sales are
 *     declared too early and older invoices paid this quarter drop out entirely;
 *   · the note that says "Kasstelsel actief — de BTW is berekend op de BETAALdatum" disappears
 *     with it, so the concept looks like an ordinary accrual one;
 *   · undatedPaidCount becomes 0, taking the "dit concept is mogelijk te laag" warning with it.
 *
 * Nothing on any screen contradicts it. So: degrade on a missing column, throw on anything else.
 * Every caller (aangifte, readiness, closing package, the truth lens) already lets a failed read
 * throw — their invoice and bank reads go through fetchAllRows, which does exactly this — so the
 * request fails with a message instead of quietly declaring on the wrong basis.
