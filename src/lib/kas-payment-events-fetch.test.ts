// [MERGE-SCHEME] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/kas-payment-events-fetch.test.ts
//
// mergeSchemeOpts exists BECAUSE it was got wrong. Its own header records it: three call sites
// combined the caller's per-invoice maps with the ones the kasstelsel read for the settled
// quarter, and two of the three OVERWROTE instead of merging. compute-result-range had it right;
// /api/aangifte overwrote exemptShareByInvoice one line below a comment explaining why merging was
// necessary, and /api/readiness overwrote both.
//
// What that costs is not a rounding difference. An invoice whose exempt share lives only in the
// map that was thrown away counts as 0% exempt, so the whole settlement is declared as TAXED
// turnover: the owner pays BTW on exempt omzet, on a filed aangifte, and nothing anywhere
// contradicts itself.
//
// So the function became the one place that cannot be half-applied — and then had no test. This
// is that test. It is small on purpose: the value is not in covering many shapes, it is in pinning
// the two properties that were violated (nothing is dropped; the precedence is stated) and the one
// that keeps it deploy-safe (absent stays absent).
