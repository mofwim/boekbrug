// src/lib/supplier-merge.ts
// [LEVERANCIER-SAMENVOEGEN] When are two supplier rows one company — and when are they two?
//
// ── WHY THIS DOOR HAD TO BE GUARDED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT ──
//
// The registry, the aliases and the name picker all fix the FUTURE: the next invoice from a
// company the owner has already corrected resolves to the right row. None of them touches the
// PAST. Two rows that already exist for one company stay two, /dashboard/leveranciers draws two
// lines, and the outstanding balance is split between the halves.
//
// So a merge door is a real gap. It is also the most dangerous door in this module, because the
// mistake it can make is not "untidy" — it is a crediteurenstand for a legal entity that does not
// exist, and a BTW return built on it.
//
// The case that decided the guard is in this repo already. From vendor-grounding.ts: an invoice
// from BALKIP B.V. — its own letterhead, its own KVK, its own IBAN, sent from info@balkip.nl —
// was imported as "GROOTHANDEL M.H. BAL V.O.F.". Two names that look like one family and are two
// companies. A merge offered on NAME SIMILARITY would have offered exactly that pair, and it is
// the one pair that must never be offered.
//
// Hence: this module never looks at names. A merge is proposed only on an identifier that IS the
// company — the KVK number, or the bank account its invoices are billed from.
//
// ── THE FOUR ANSWERS ──
//
//   different-kvk   two Chamber-of-Commerce numbers are two legal entities. An absolute veto: it
//                   outranks every other kind of evidence, because nothing can make two registry
//                   numbers one company.
//   two-accounts    each row names its OWN bank account. Merging would keep one and drop the
//                   other, and suppliers.iban is what the IBAN-change check compares next month's
//                   invoice against — so the dropped account would make every genuine invoice on
//                   it look like a redirected payment. The owner can clear one and come back.
//   no-evidence     nothing here PROVES one party. Two rows that merely read alike are the
//                   BALKIP case, and this module has no opinion about them.
//   ok              a shared KVK, or a shared account. Both are the company itself.
//
// Pure — no I/O. The server does the reads and re-runs this on what it read, never on what a
// browser claimed. Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/supplier-merge.test.ts

// [ÉÉN-LEVERANCIERSSLEUTEL] The registry's own normalizers, not second copies of them. identityIban
// is identity and not merely shape: a misread account number keys nothing, and keying a MERGE on a
// misread would be the worst place in the app to accept one.
