// src/lib/enablebanking-map.ts
// [ENABLEBANKING] Berlin Group snake_case JSON → our canonical BankTransaction. Pure, no I/O.
//
// ── Read this before touching the amount ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The amount here is a MAGNITUDE and the sign lives somewhere else:
//
//     transaction_amount.amount = "15.0"     ← no sign, ever
//     credit_debit_indicator    = "DBIT"     ← the direction
//
// Verified against the vendor's own sample export: 611 transactions, 439 of them DBIT, and not one
// amount string carries a minus sign. Aggregators differ on exactly this — GoCardless, which this
// integration first targeted, sends an already-signed amount and NO indicator — so a mapper written
// from memory of another provider imports every expense as income. Not a display bug: kosten become
// omzet, the btw-aangifte inverts, and every figure the accountant signs is wrong in the direction
// that looks like a good quarter. On a real ING quarter that is −€1.578,93 read as +€361.165,81.
//
// The split is exactly CAMT.053's <Amt> + <CdtDbtInd>, so parseCAMT053Entry is the template for
// this file — branch for branch, in the same order.
//
// ── The one property this file exists to protect ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A transaction can enter BoekBrug by more than one door: the owner uploads an MT940/CAMT file,
// or his bank feeds it to us over PSD2. Sooner or later both doors carry the SAME transaction.
// Cross-upload dedup (bank-import.ts) keys on
//
//     contentKey = date | amount | dedupName(counterpartName) | norm(reference)
//
// so if this mapper derives a name or a reference even SLIGHTLY differently from bank-parser.ts,
// the same transaction lands in the table twice and every figure built on it doubles. That is
// why nothing below re-implements those rules: it reshapes the JSON into what parseCAMT053Entry
// sees and then calls the SAME helpers — extractInvoiceReference, deriveReadableName — in the
// SAME order. Every branch mirrors a numbered branch there; when you change one, change both.
//
// ── What this was written against ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// TWO sources, and they do not carry the same authority. Read this before citing either.
//
//   1. Enable Banking's own sample accounts-data export — the shape their mock ASPSP serves back.
//      This is the vendor speaking, and it is what the FIELD NAMES and the credit_debit_indicator
//      convention rest on. It is Danish, so it exercises none of the Dutch text patterns.
//   2. A real ING business quarter, 576 transactions — but reshaped into this JSON from ING's CSV
//      export, NOT captured from a live Enable Banking response. The money in it is real (its
//      signed sum lands on the bank's own closing balance to the cent) and so are the Dutch
//      strings, which is why the Dutch branches below are tuned against it. What it does NOT
//      establish is how the live PSD2 feed shapes those strings — a converter stood in between.
//
// So: field-level facts come from (1). Text-level behaviour is tuned against (2) and written to be
// INERT when the text does not look like that — see statementRemittance. Three things stay
// unverified until a real /accounts/{id}/transactions response is in hand, each called out at its
// branch: whether the live model carries an end-to-end id (the vendor sample has none), whether
// remittance_information is ever longer than one element, and whether a Dutch bank really delivers
// its composed statement line as the remittance.

 *

 *     Kenmerk: 260514RABONL2U080320000100001 Valutadatum: 25-05-2026
 *
 * Every one of those labels is data the CAMT file carries in its OWN element — `<Cdtr><Nm>`,
 * `<CdtrAcct><IBAN>`, `<Refs>` — and that we already read from this transaction's own fields. Only
 * `Omschrijving:` is the remittance. Leaving the rest in is not cosmetic: extractInvoiceReference
 * then scoops up the Kenmerk, the Machtiging ID and the account digits, so a real ING quarter
 * produced "TK10000001, 100001" where the file door produces nothing at all, and
 * "600000001, 5049NM, INC000000001, 5000000001, MID100000001" where it produces "600000001, 5049NM".
 * That is the [BANK-REF-ONE-SOURCE] triple failure exactly: a different reference is a different
 * contentKey (a double import), it makes parseReferenceNumbers count several invoices so
 * autoConfirmTier stops auto-booking the line, and isFullyCovered can then never be satisfied.
 *
 * WHERE THAT TEXT CAME FROM, precisely, because it decides how much this function may assume: it
 * is a real ING business quarter, but reshaped into this JSON from ING's CSV export — not a live
 * Enable Banking response. So the STRINGS are ING's and the failure above is real, while "the PSD2
 * feed delivers them this way" is NOT established. That is why the function is inert by default:
 * text that is not recognisably composed is returned untouched, so if the live feed sends a clean
 * remittance this branch never fires. Confirm it against a real /accounts/{id}/transactions
 * response before treating it as ING's wire format.
 *
 * A composition with no `Omschrijving:` at all is a transfer the payer left blank — the file door
 * has an empty `<Ustrd>` there, so this returns empty rather than handing the metadata downstream
 * as if it were the payer's text.
 *
 * Anything that is not recognisably composed is returned untouched. The recognition is deliberately
 * narrow — an explicit `Omschrijving:` label, or a line that OPENS with `Naam:` — because the
 * failure mode of guessing wrong is to throw away a payer's description, invoice number and all.
 * A remittance that itself contains "IBAN:" is the known limit: ING destroyed the boundary when it
 * composed the line, and no reader can put it back.
