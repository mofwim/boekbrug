// The findings from the audit of the notification + message surface, held as gates.
//
// They share one shape. Every one of them is a place where the app KNEW something — that a
// notification was refused, that a message could not be sent, that a name could not be read, that
// the list on screen was not the whole list — and the person it concerned was shown something else,
// or nothing. None of it throws, so none of it is visible from a log or a Sentry alert; the screen
// simply looks calm and says the wrong thing.
//
// They are source-level because that is where these defects live: not in what a function returns,
// but in which client it uses, which branch swallows a result, and which sentence is printed when a
// read failed.

 * real comment always follows a line start, whitespace, or one of `{(,;=`, while the `/*` inside a
 * string like `accept=".pdf,image/*"` follows a letter or a dot. Without that rule this helper
 * deletes live code, and every doesNotMatch gate over the hole then passes vacuously.
