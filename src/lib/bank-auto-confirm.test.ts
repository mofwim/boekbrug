//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// runBankAutoConfirm is the only code in this app that moves money with nobody watching: it runs
// from cron, from intake, from an e-mail arriving. Until now no test had ever CALLED it. The pure
// parts underneath were well covered — planBatchAutoConfirm, scorePair, applyConfidenceVeto all
// have their own suites — but the COMPOSITION was covered by nothing, and the composition is where
// the order of the passes lives.
//
// That mattered, because the order is the safety property. [BANK-BATCH-FIRST] says the batch pass
// runs before the scored 1:1 pass, and the reason is written in the file: a same-supplier
// same-amount solo line could otherwise claim an invoice that a printed-number bundle provably
// owns — the bundle then never ties, and its invoice sits linked to the wrong payment. Before this
// file, swapping those two blocks broke nothing that any gate could see.
//
// ── HOW IT RUNS WITHOUT A DATABASE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Both clients are arguments, so the pass takes a fake. The fake answers reads from a table map
// and RECORDS every write, which is what the assertions read: not "did it return something" but
// "which invoice did it mark paid, against which bank line".

/**
 * The smallest thing that behaves like the Supabase client this pass uses: chainable filters that
 * resolve to the table's rows, `.maybeSingle()` for the one profile read, and `.update()` /
 * `.rpc()` recorded rather than performed.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a filter engine. It returns the whole table and lets the pass do its own
 * filtering in TypeScript, so a test that passes here is a test about the PASS's logic and not
 * about how faithfully a hand-written fake reimplements PostgREST.
