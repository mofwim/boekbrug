// lib/bank-import.ts
// [BOEK-016] Pure import helpers: content fingerprint + cross-upload dedup + DB-row mapping.
// No I/O — testable with `npx tsx`. The route (api/bank/upload) is a thin shell over these.
//
// Dedup design — THREE layers, cheapest and most certain first. Each exists because the one
// below it cannot answer the question the one above it answers.
//
//   1. The FILE (bank-ingest.ts). Identical bytes = a statement already imported. Checked before
//      parsing, so a re-upload of the same file does no work and takes no risk.
//   2. The SOURCE'S OWN ID (sourceKey / dedupTransactions layer 1). A bank names every
//      transaction it exports and the name is unique within that export — measured on one real
//      ING quarter: 576 transactions, 576 distinct MT940 `:61:` refs, 576 distinct CAMT
//      <NtryRef>. Backed by a UNIQUE index (bank_tx_source_identity.sql), so it holds even when
//      two writers race — an upload during the daily cron sync — which no application-level
//      read-then-write can promise.
//   3. The CONTENT FINGERPRINT (contentKey). The ONLY layer that recognises the same payment
//      arriving through a DIFFERENT door, because the doors share no ids at all: between that
//      quarter's MT940 and CAMT ids the overlap is ZERO. Necessarily a judgement call, which is
//      why it is last and why bank-parity.test.ts pins it.
//
// Constant across all three: we must NOT collapse legitimate identical transactions inside a
// single statement (two €4 coffees, same day, same description = two real transactions). Hence a
// multiset diff, and hence an existing row may be consumed only ONCE, by whichever layer claims
// it. Under-counting the owner's money is worse than the visible double it would prevent.
//       first upload          → existing 0, file 2 coffees → insert 2
//       re-upload same file    → existing 2, file 2 coffees → insert 0
//       new period (new date)  → different key             → insert as new

 *
 * That settles ONE question with certainty — "has this source already delivered this line?" — and

 * parser improves. Re-uploading a statement imported before yesterday's MT940 reference fix would
 * insert every line again; keyed on the bank's own id it cannot.
 *
 * It settles NOTHING about the cross-door case. The same 576 transactions have ZERO ids in common
 * between the two formats — ING does not name a payment the same way twice — so `source` is part
 * of the key and the fingerprint below remains the only thing that can bridge doors.

/**
 * Stable content fingerprint for cross-upload dedup.

 * the stored description (the raw REMI) differs between the two formats for every
 * transaction — MT940 keeps ING's "USTD//29528/" wrapper, CAMT gives a clean
 * "29528" — so a description-based key never matched across formats and every
 * transaction was re-inserted on the second upload (an exact ×2 doubling of
 * in/uit). date + amount + reference are IDENTICAL across formats; the counterpart
 * NAME is the one field whose representation can differ per format (MT940/CAMT
 * DERIVE it from the REMI, a CSV reads it from a dedicated column), so it is
 * normalized via dedupName — collapsing "B.V." vs "BV" while keeping the digits
 * that distinguish separate transactions. Verified 30/30 match on MT940↔CAMT with
 * zero collisions (incl. 20 reference-less POS settlements distinguished by amount).
 *
 * [BANK-DEDUP-CSV] CSV↔MT940/CAMT re-upload of the SAME period: invoice transfers
 * (a real counterparty name) now dedup across formats thanks to dedupName. Card/POS
 * lines whose CSV column name carries a terminal/store number the derived MT940 name
 * lacks (e.g. "Albert Heijn 1234" vs "Albert Heijn") can still both import — the
 * accepted residual edge, chosen over merging distinct transactions. Same-FORMAT
 * re-upload (the common case) always dedups exactly. Two genuinely identical
