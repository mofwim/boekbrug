// Input : BankTransaction[] (from bank-parser.ts, any format) + invoices (from DB).
// Output: per-transaction match outcome ('auto' | 'choice' | 'none') with scored candidates.
//
// Philosophy (BoekBrug): "AI prepares + presents, Human confirms, System executes."
// This engine ONLY suggests. It never writes to the DB and never changes invoice status.
//
// Design notes:
//   - Pure & deterministic → testable with `npx tsx` (no Supabase, no fetch).
//   - Signed amount respects direction (M-confirmed):
//       outgoing invoice  ↔ positive credit (ontvangen)
//       incoming invoice  ↔ negative debit  (betaald)
//   - B.4 Conflict Guard: invoices with accountant_status='verwerkt' are NEVER suggested
//     (the DB trigger blocks the status change anyway — don't suggest the impossible).
//   - AI arbiter (ai.ts → matchTransaction) is a SEPARATE later phase; not called here.

 * [BANK-ONE-PAYMENT-MANY-INVOICES] while match/route.ts kept counting number-shaped tokens in
 * the reference, so a line whose every euro was booked still reported allCovered=false as soon
 * as one reference token was not a paid invoice number (a customer or order number, a POS batch
 * counter, or the free text the extractor falls back to when it finds no invoice number). Such a
 * line never leaves "Te bevestigen": confirming it again can only return 409, the client treats
 * that as done and re-fetches, and the card comes straight back — an unbreakable loop.
 *
 * Returns null when the line is NOT MEASURABLE (no join rows, or a link written before
 * amount_applied existed): the sum is then a lower bound, not the truth, and answering
 * "covered" from it would hide money. Callers fall back to isFullyCovered, which is
 * conservative by design — an unresolved number keeps the line visible, never hides on doubt.
 *
 * @param txAmount     the bank line's signed amount (magnitude is what counts).
 * @param appliedTotal Σ amount_applied over the line's links, or null when not measurable.
