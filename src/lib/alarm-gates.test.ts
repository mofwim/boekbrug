// [ALARM] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/alarm-gates.test.ts
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
//
// Sentry is installed and correctly wired: instrumentation.ts exports onRequestError, so a route
// that CRASHES is seen. This product is built not to crash. Its whole design is gates that refuse
// politely — a read that could not run, a duplicate check that did not happen, a booking held back,
// an invariant left bent. Each one catches the failure, tells the owner in Dutch, and logs a line.
//
// No exception is thrown, so Sentry sees nothing, and the line goes to a runtime log nobody opens.
// That is the same shape this codebase spends its comments on: a problem noticed and told to no one.
//
// A handful of those states are ones the code itself calls impossible — "the exact state this
// design promises never exists", "amount_paid drift", "reminders are DISABLED". Those must reach a
// person. This gate holds that wiring, because nothing else can: a console.error that should have
// been an alarm looks exactly like a console.error that is correctly just a log.
