// src/lib/direct-debit.ts
// [DD-SIGNAL] Does the bank statement itself say this was an automatische incasso?
//
// It does. Every format carries it, and the app was reading straight past all of them:
//
//   · MT940 — the :61: line ends with a four-character transaction type code, and NDDT is
//     Direct Debit. parseMT940Transaction ALREADY captures it: `(N[A-Z0-9]{3})?` is group 6 of
//     its regex. The line that destructures the match skips group 6 with a bare comma.
//   · CAMT.053 — <BkTxCd> carries the ISO family (RDDT = a direct debit received against this
//     account), and <Refs> carries <MndtId>, the machtigingskenmerk. Neither is read.
//   · CSV — ING has a `Code` column whose value for an incasso is literally "IC", and a
//     `Mutatiesoort` column whose value is "Incasso". Rabobank gives it two dedicated columns:
//     `Machtigingskenmerk` and `Incassant ID`. mapColumns maps seven roles; none is any of these.
//   · Free text — ABN AMRO writes "SEPA Incasso algemeen doorlopend" with "Incassant:" and
//     "Machtiging:" in the description; the ING statement line the PSD2 mapper un-composes names
//     "Machtiging ID" and "Incassant ID" as segment labels — it knows them well enough to stop at
//     them, and then discards them.
//
// ── THE RULE, STRONGEST FIRST ──
// A mandate reference or a creditor identifier is PROOF. A SEPA direct debit cannot exist without
// a mandate — that is what the debtor signed — and an ordinary transfer never carries one. Those
// two are therefore treated as certain, and everything else as an indication.
//
// The incassant-ID has a fixed shape: NL + two check digits + ZZZ + twelve digits (KVK plus a
// branch counter), e.g. NL32ZZZ411951220000. Recognising it in free text is how the ABN and SNS
// exports are read, where there is no column to ask.
//
// ── DIRECTION IS PART OF THE ANSWER ──
// A direct-debit marker on a POSITIVE amount is not a collection, it is a storno — the collection
// bounced and the bank put the money back. Reading it as "this supplier collects automatically"
// would be exactly backwards: a storno means the invoice is NOT paid, and it is the one event that
// must never be evidence for a mandate. So the sign is read here rather than left to callers.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no clock. The parsers hand it what they read; it answers what that means.
