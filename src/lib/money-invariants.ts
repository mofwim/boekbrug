//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT ANOTHER GATE ──
//
// Every money gate in this app guards a MOMENT: is this read right, does this payment fit, may this
// invoice auto-book. They are all about the euro that is arriving. None of them ever looks back at
// the euros that already landed.
//
// So the question nobody in this codebase can answer is the one an accountant asks first: do the
// books still add up? Not "was each write correct when it happened" — every write believed it was —
// but is the RESULT internally consistent right now. Those are different questions, and only the
// second survives a concurrent booking, a half-applied batch, a migration applied out of order, or
// a bug that has since been fixed but left its numbers behind.
//
// books-audit.ts already re-checks a stored amount against the DOCUMENT it came from. This is the
// other axis: the money tables against EACH OTHER. A figure can be perfectly grounded in its
// invoice and still be impossible next to its payments.
//
// ── IT REPORTS EUROS, NOT ROWS ──
//
// "3 invoices inconsistent" tells nobody anything. "€4.212 booked as paid that no payment covers"
// tells you whether to stop what you are doing. Every finding carries the amount at stake, because
// that is the number that decides whether it waits until Monday.
//
// ── AND IT NEVER FIXES ANYTHING ──
//
// Same rule as books-audit.ts, and for a sharper reason: a violation means two sources disagree,
// and an automatic repair has to pick one. Picking wrong writes a false number over a true one and
// destroys the evidence that they ever differed. On a quarter that is already filed that is not a
// bug, it is a correction nobody can trace. This states what it found. Deciding is human work.
//
// NOTE ON LANGUAGE: identifiers and comments are English (AGENTS.md); `message` is Dutch because
// the owner and their accountant read it.

    // the link before or with the un-pay. So in a healthy administration the pair cannot disagree.

// ─── [GELD-INVARIANT-KAS] The drawer, checked backwards ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above this line is about invoices, bank lines and the links between them. The CASH
// drawer was not in this file at all, and it is the one ledger where the module's own opening
// argument applies hardest: cash-settle.ts does not merely admit that its passes can fail, it
// NAMES the states they leave behind, in its own reportHandledFailure calls —
//
//   "cash settlement entry not created — the kas balance is now too high"
//   "orphaned cash settlements not removed — the kas balance is now too low"
//   "cash reconcile threw — the drawer may be left half-healed"
//
// — and then nothing ever looks again. Each of those is reported once, to Sentry, at the moment it
// happens. The drawer stays out of step until someone counts the money by hand, and the same drawer
// decides whether a BTW-aangifte may be filed at all (readiness.ts, /api/btw/file).
//
// ── IT ASKS THE RECONCILER, IT DOES NOT SECOND-GUESS IT ──
//
// The check is not a second opinion about what the drawer should hold. It runs the SAME pure
// function the app reconciles with (computeCashSettlementSync) over the live data and reports what
// that function still WANTS to change. In an administration in step it wants nothing: the reconcile
// runs on every kasboek read and hourly. So anything it wants is a state that survived those.
//
// A second implementation of "what the drawer should hold" would eventually disagree with the first
// one, and then this audit would report differences that exist only between the two spellings —
// which is how an audit stops being believed. Same reason loadCashSettlementState was extracted
// rather than re-read here.
//
// ── A SNAPSHOT, NOT A VERDICT ON THE PAST ──
//
// A finding can heal itself: open the Kas page and the reconcile runs. That is not a flaw, it is the
// signal — a finding that comes back on the NEXT run is one the self-healing cannot reach, and those
// are exactly the three states above.
