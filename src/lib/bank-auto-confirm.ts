// [BANK-AUTO-CONFIRM-CORE] The server-side safe-set pass, extracted so the circle closes from
// ANY entry point — the /bank page, an invoice verify, a bank IMPORT, and a background cron —
// not only when a browser happens to sit on /dashboard/bank. It books the two auto tiers:
// 'certain' (invoice number printed in the statement OR supplier IBAN, + amount to the cent —
// booked silently) and 'amount_only' (exact amount + an identity that is not the document's own:
// a strong counterpart name with date proximity, the account the supplier is known to bill from,
// or the owner's own pay-sheet declaration — single clear winner, booked but flagged "controleer";
// under kasstelsel only into a quarter whose aangifte has NOT been filed, see kas-auto-book.ts),
// plus the provably-exact multi-invoice batch ties. Fully reversible (owner can unlink) and audited.
//
// payClient vs pipeline: the invoice→'paid' write goes through `payClient`. A ROUTE passes its
// SESSION client, so the DB 'verwerkt' guard trigger fires with a real auth.uid(); a CRON or a
// server IMPORT (no session) passes the service-role `pipeline`, where the app-level isEligible
// check below is the authoritative guard (it already rejects a 'verwerkt' invoice). The bank
// line link + all reads always use the service-role `pipeline` (user-pinned by user_id).
