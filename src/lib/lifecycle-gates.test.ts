// Findings from the end-to-end audit of an invoice's life, held as gates.
//
// Every one of these is the same shape: a refusal that was WRITTEN, argued for at length in its own
// comment, and then made unreachable by a sibling line — a nested guard, or a newer code path that
// returns before it. Nothing turns red when that happens. The invoice imports, the payment books,
// the screen looks right, and the only trace is a number in the books that nobody will question
// until an accountant does, a year later.
//
// They are source-level because that is where the defect lives. Both of these are about the ORDER
// and the PLACEMENT of code, not about what any function returns when you call it.

// ─── [DEDUP-READ-HONEST] A failed duplicate probe must not read as "no duplicate" ─────
//
// supabase-js does not throw. A timed-out probe on a busy invoices table gives { data: null } →
// `?? []` → no candidate found → possibleDup null. If the "we could not run the check" marker is
// only written when a candidate WAS found, it can never be written at all — and the invoice then
// reads 'clean' to classifyImportHealth and AUTO-BOOKS.
//
// The cost, concretely: a paper invoice photographed after the same invoice arrived by e-mail (the
// bytes differ, so the hash gate correctly misses) becomes a second purchase invoice with no human
// in the loop — a second cost in the P&L and a second voorbelasting claim, discoverable only by
// reading the inkoopboek line by line.

// for the other, and when that invoice arrives it reads fully open, gets dunned, and is paid a
// second time.
//
// It was written, argued for ("waiting is reversible and a wrong booking is not"), and then a newer
// atomic RPC was added ABOVE it that books and returns. From the moment bank_confirm_atomic.sql was
// applied, the refusal was unreachable — it survived only on the pre-migration fall-through. A
// guard that runs after the write is not a guard.
