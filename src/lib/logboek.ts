// src/lib/logboek.ts
// [LOGBOEK] One row of audit_logs, turned into something a screen can render. Pure — no I/O, no
// React, no Supabase client. Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/logboek.test.ts
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──
//
// audit_logs is written from 60 files in 89 distinct actions, and not one of those rows has ever
// been rendered anywhere. That was survivable while the owner was the only person writing: what
// had happened in the administration was what they had just done themselves, and the notification
// they got at that moment was enough. It stopped being survivable when a mandated bookkeeper could
// issue invoices under the owner's BTW number, remind their customers and confirm their purchase
// invoices — every one of those rows carries the BOOKKEEPER in user_id, because user_id is the
// ACTOR. The owner, who stays liable for all of it (art. 35a Wet OB, art. 52 AWR), could see
// exactly none of it. audit_logs_client_read.sql opened the read side for that case; this module is
// the other half — the rules that turn a row into a sentence, a category and a link, with nothing
// in them that needs a database, a session or a browser.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES: NOTHING IS EVER DROPPED ──
//
// toLogboekEntry has no failure path. It does not return null, does not throw, and does not skip a
// row it cannot phrase. An audit trail that hides what it has no words for is not an audit trail:
// the gaps are invisible, so the owner reads what is left as the complete story. A row whose action
// nobody ever wrote a sentence for still comes back as an entry — hasSentence() reports that there
// is no sentence, the copy layer renders 'log.onbekend' ("Handeling vastgelegd") next to the raw
// action name, and the row is on the screen with its timestamp intact. "We cannot phrase this" and
// "this never happened" are different answers, and the screen has to be able to give the first one.
//
// ── WHY audit.ts IS NOT IMPORTED HERE, NOT EVEN FOR ITS TYPE ──
//
// audit.ts imports supabase-pipeline, which builds the SERVICE_ROLE client. This module is meant to
// be safe inside a client component. `import type` is erased under isolatedModules, so it would be
// harmless today — but the next reader who needs one VALUE from that module rather than a type
// would not notice they had just pulled the service-role client into a browser bundle. The link to
// audit.ts is therefore made by the test, which reads the AuditAction union out of the file and
// fails when the two drift apart. A gate with no runtime edge at all.

 *   · snelstart.* is a bookkeeping coupling, and 'snelstart.pushed' moves bookings into the
 *     administration proper. Money.
 *
 * Anything not on this list is 'system' — the safe default, and the only honest one for an action

/**

 *      exist. A sentence deleted from messages.ts fails the build here, rather than turning into a
 *      blank line on the owner's screen months later.
 *   2. The [TAAL] gate in lifecycle-gates.test.ts scans production files for the keys they render
 *      and reports every catalogue entry that nothing reaches as an orphan. A key that is only ever
 *      built by concatenation is invisible to it, so 89 real sentences would read as dead weight
 *      and the next tidy-up would delete them.
 *   3. hasSentence() can then answer for ANY string the database hands it — including the 40
 *      historical rows that predate this union — without reading the catalogue at runtime.
 *
 * The order is audit.ts's own, headings included, so the two lists can be compared by eye. The test
 * does it properly, in both directions.
