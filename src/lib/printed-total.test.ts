// [PRINTED-TOTAL] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/printed-total.test.ts
//
// ── WHY A TEST THAT READS SOURCE ──
// The defect this closes is not in a function. It is in an INSTRUCTION: the reader used to be told
// "never return a btw_amount that makes total_ex_btw + btw_amount differ from the printed Totaal te
// voldoen". Given a mixed-rate summary block it had mis-summed, the cheapest way to obey was to move
// the total — and the triplet it handed back was internally perfect and quietly wrong.
//
// Enka Horeca 26701681: excl 1.213,50 · btw 122,18 · totaal 1.335,68, against a paper that says
// 122,64 and 1.336,14. Every gate in the app passed it, correctly, because each of them tests the
// three numbers against each other and they had been made to agree.
//
// There is no unit to test that on. The prompt is a string, the evidence it asks for is optional by
// nature, and a well-meant edit ("tidy up the amount rules") can delete the whole mechanism without
// breaking a single existing assertion. So the mechanism is pinned where it lives: in the file.
//
// What is being held, in one line each:
//   · the reader is ASKED for the two independent witnesses (the printed total, the per-rate block);
//   · it is NOT told to balance the three amounts;
//   · what it returns is STORED rather than dropped on the floor;
//   · an amount WE computed is marked as ours;
//   · and the invoice that started this reads as "not fully checked" end to end.
