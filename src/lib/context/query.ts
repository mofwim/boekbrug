// src/lib/context/query.ts
// [SAMENHANG] What is connected to what, for an actor who is allowed to see it. Server only.
//
// ── WHAT THIS LAYER IS, AND THE FOUR THINGS IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// It answers one question: what is related to this thing? It does NOT answer what the thing is
// worth, what state it is in, or what should happen to it. Those belong to the domain engines, and
// the separation is not a slogan here — it is enforced by the shape of ContextNode, which has room
// for an id, a kind and a label and nowhere to put an amount.
//
//   not a CRM            — it stores no customer of its own
//   not a warehouse      — it stores nothing at all; every answer is derived at read time
//   not a graph database — it is five joins over foreign keys that already exist
//   not a source of truth — a projection cannot duplicate a fact, because it has nowhere to keep one
//
// That last line is why V1 is a projection and not a table. The repository already has 130 foreign
// keys with real referential integrity; a row in a generic `relationships` table would be a SECOND
// assertion of a fact the database already enforces, and keeping two assertions equal is exactly
// the duplication this engine was asked to remove rather than add.
//
// ── AUTHORIZATION IS NOT A FILTER APPLIED AFTERWARDS ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every function here takes an ActingContext and never resolves one. A module that could call
// resolveActingContext() itself would be a module that could be called without one, and
// "getInvoiceContext(invoiceId)" returning rows to whoever asks is precisely the door the
// specification forbids. The flow is fixed, and it starts outside this file:
//
//     resolveActingContext()  →  authorize()  →  Context query
//
// Inside, each EDGE is authorized separately, at resource level, against the entity it reaches.
// The rule is one sentence — an edge is visible when its far end is — and everything else follows
// from the permission catalogue without this file knowing what a sales member is.
//
// ── THERE IS NO API ROUTE YET, AND THAT IS A DECISION ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// One was written — /api/context/[type]/[id], walking resolveActingContext → authorize → query in
// exactly the order the specification asks for — and [GEEN-DEUR] refused it: no screen called it.
// The gate is right, and it is the same objection this file makes elsewhere about a catalogue
// nobody asks. A route with no caller is surface with an attack surface and no user.
//
// So the door was deleted instead of being added to that gate's allow-list, which is for routes
// unreachable ON PURPOSE and not for ones whose caller has not been written yet. This layer is a
// library until a screen needs it, and the screen will bring its own route — which will then pass
// [GEEN-DEUR] because it is used, rather than because somebody made an exception for it.
//
// ── AND A PARTIAL ANSWER SAYS THAT IT IS PARTIAL ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [NO-SILENT-EMPTY] applies with a twist: an actor who may not see an edge must not learn what it
// was, and must still be told that something is there. So refused edges are COUNTED into
// `withheld` and never described. Zero relations with withheld = 3 is a different answer from zero
// relations with withheld = 0, and a screen that shows "niets gevonden" for the first one is lying.

// No "server-only" marker: the package is not a dependency of this repo (session-user.ts explains
// why), and this module needs no marker in any case. It creates NO database client — the caller
// hands it a reader. That is not only a purity nicety: it means every branch below, including the
// counting of what an actor may not see, is exercised by an ordinary unit test with a fake reader,
// instead of being the kind of authorization code that is only ever run in production.

 * resource whose creator cannot be proved. Correctly so: decision.ts refuses to guess.

 * this invoice", asked of the invoice's own row. What the document keeps for itself is the TENANT
 * check: its user_id must still be inside the administration, because inheriting a right must
