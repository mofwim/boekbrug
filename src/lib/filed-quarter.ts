// src/lib/filed-quarter.ts
// [SUPPLETIE] The one door to the question "did this change touch a quarter that has already been
// filed, and by how much did it move?"
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──
//
// A BTW-aangifte that has been sent to the Belastingdienst is a statement made on a date. The books
// keep moving after it — a late supplier invoice, a misread total corrected — and when they move,
// the owner acquires an OBLIGATION they did not have a moment earlier: art. 10a AWR jo. art. 15
// Uitvoeringsbesluit OB 1968 requires them to report the difference. Over €1.000 that is a formal
// suppletie; €1.000 or less may be carried into the next regular aangifte.
//
// The app already froze the snapshot (btw_filings) and already computed the divergence
// (btw-filing.ts), and both are correct. What was missing is that nothing ASKED at the moment the
// books moved. The divergence was visible on two screens to an owner who happened to open them,
// which for a time-bound legal obligation is the same as not knowing.
//
// ── WHY THE CORRECTION IS NOT BLOCKED ──
//
// The sales side refuses an edit once the quarter is filed, and for an invoice the owner ISSUED
// that is right: the document went to a customer, and the way back is a creditnota. A PURCHASE
// invoice is the opposite case. The owner cannot issue a credit note against their own supplier,
// and the number in the books is not their statement but a reading of someone else's paper. When
// that reading was wrong, correcting it is not tampering with a filed quarter — it is the very
// thing that produces the suppletie. Refusing it would leave the books permanently wrong AND leave
// the Belastingdienst uninformed, which is worse in both directions at once.
//
// So: allow, compute, and say the number.
