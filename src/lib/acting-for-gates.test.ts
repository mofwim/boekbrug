// [ACTING-FOR] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/acting-for-gates.test.ts
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
//
// A sales member shares the session shape of an ordinary user: they are logged in, they have a
// user.id, and every existing invoice route assumes THAT id owns the administration. The routes
// they need have been rebuilt to act ON BEHALF OF the owner (see the REBUILT list below); the
// rest is deliberately closed (owner-only.ts).
//
// THE BUG THIS PREVENTS
// In six months someone adds /api/invoice/something-new, writes `sender_id: user.id` like
// everywhere else, and nothing visible happens — except that a member opens a second number
// series under the same VAT number there. Art. 35 Wet OB requires gapless sequential numbering,
// and an issued number never comes back. You discover a mistake like that during an audit, not
// in an error message.
//
// Hence: every route under /api/invoice must do ONE OF TWO things — resolve the owner
// (getActingFor) or refuse a member (requireOwner). Saying nothing is not an option.
