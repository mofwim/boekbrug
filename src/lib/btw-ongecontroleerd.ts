// [BTW-ONGECONTROLEERD] Reclaimed BTW that nothing in this app has been able to check.
// Pure, no I/O. Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/btw-ongecontroleerd.test.ts
//
// ── THE ONE CASE NO OTHER GATE SEES ──
//
// Every arithmetic check this app owns rests on one of two constraints:
//   · the identity — excl + btw = incl, which safecore enforces everywhere; and
//   · the RATE — 0, 9 or 21, the only ones that exist in the Netherlands.
//
// A MIXED-RATE invoice satisfies the first by construction and escapes the second: with 9 % and
// 21 % lines on one document the blended rate can legally be anything between them, so "12,4 %"
// proves nothing. The only witness left is the per-rate specification block, and btw-split.ts is
// the only thing that can read it.
//
// Which means: a blended invoice WITHOUT that block carries voorbelasting that no check in this
// app has ever verified, and it looks perfectly clean on every screen. Measured on the live
// administration: 31 incoming invoices carry a blended rate, 28 of them hold no block, and
// together they claim € 2.635,83 back.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A READINESS ITEM AND NOT A NEW SCREEN ──
//
// [SPLIT-ALSNOG] already built the way back: a re-read that checks the split and overwrites
// nothing, reachable from the invoice's own document sheet. The capability is not missing. What is
// missing is that nothing tells the owner WHICH of 608 invoices needs it — and the place they
// already ask "is this quarter safe to file?" is readiness, beside [GEEN-BTW-SOORT], which is the
// same species of doubt: BTW being reclaimed that may not be reclaimable.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT SAY ──
//
// Not that the amount is wrong. A blended rate is NORMAL on a wholesale invoice and most of these
// are almost certainly right. It says only that nothing checked it — which is exactly the register
// [IBAN-CHECK-HONEST] and [EIGEN-CONTROLE-ONBEKEND] use, and never a verdict the paper contradicts.
