// src/lib/ubl-inputs.ts
// [E-FACTUUR] The database rows an e-factuur is built from, mapped once.
// Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/ubl-inputs.test.ts
//
// ── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE ──
//
// buildInvoiceUbl() is pure and well tested, and for a long time it had exactly one caller: the
// download button behind /api/export/ubl. That route therefore owned both the SELECT literals and
// the row → generator mapping, which was fine while it was alone.
//
// It is not alone any more. The quarter package hands the accountant the same e-factuur next to
// the invoice's PDF, and a second copy of this mapping is the kind of duplication that does not
// announce itself: the two would agree on the day they were written and drift on the first column
// anybody adds, producing two e-facturen of one invoice that differ — the exact document where
// "nearly the same" is worthless.
//
// ── AND WHY THE MAPPING IS THE DANGEROUS HALF, NOT THE SELECT ──
//
// A forgotten column in a SELECT fails loudly: PostgREST answers 42703 and nothing is exported.
// A column that is SELECTED and then not passed on fails silently — the generator reads
// `undefined`, takes its "this deployment does not have that column yet" branch, and writes a
// valid file with a fact missing from it.
//
// That has now happened twice in this codebase. `vat_treatment` was selected and not passed, so
// an exempt line (art. 11 Wet OB) exported as category Z — a 0%-TAXED supply, which the receiver
// books differently. The comment that records that fix sits directly above `discount_type` and
// `discount_value`, which were selected and not passed either: every line discount was invisible
// in the e-factuur, so BG-27 was never written and the agreed unit price was replaced by a price
// per line that reproduces the discounted amount. The file stayed valid and stayed wrong.
//
// So the mapping lives here, once, with a test that walks the whole optional group.
