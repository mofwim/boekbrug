// [BON-BETAALWIJZE] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/intake-router-gates.test.ts
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
//
// gokBetaalwijze reads what a till PRINTS — "Bankpas", "Kontant", "Wisselgeld", "Afronding" — and
// that reading outranks the model's opinion, because the paper is evidence and the opinion is an
// interpretation. It is a pure module with its own tests, all green, all meaningless: the intake
// route built its decideFromAi() argument by hand and left `paid_evidence` and `paid_card_last4`
// out of it. One call site, two absent lines, and gokBetaalwijze received `undefined` on every
// upload this app has ever processed.
//
// Nothing failed. The types were satisfied — every field on IntakeClassification is optional, and
// they have to be: the pen-mark path genuinely has no tender line. tsc cannot tell a field that is
// absent because it does not apply from one that is absent because someone forgot it. The unit
// tests passed because they call decideFromAi directly with a full object, which is exactly the
// object the route was not building. The feature was built, tested, shipped and switched off.
//
// THE CLASS, NOT THE INSTANCE
//
// The instance is fixed. What is not fixed by that is the next field: someone extends the reader,
// adds it to IntakeClassification, tests the router with it, and forgets the route again — and the
// silence will be just as complete. So this gate reads the SOURCE and asserts the bridge is whole:
// every field the router can act on is handed to it at the call site.
//
// It deliberately does not check HOW (`v.paid_evidence ?? null`, a variable, a spread — all fine).
// It checks that the name appears inside the decideFromAi(...) argument at all, which is precisely
// the thing that was missing and precisely the thing a reviewer's eye slides over.

// ─── [MARKER-READ] A marker nobody reads is a feature that does not exist ─────
//
// bon-betaalwijze.ts reads the tender line a till PRINTS — "Bankpas 70,29", "KONTANT 120,00
// Wisselgeld 7,10" — and both intake doors stored the result in field_confidence as
// _intake_paid_method / _intake_paid_method_zeker / _intake_paid_evidence / _intake_paid_card4 /
// _intake_paid_date. Nothing anywhere read any of them back. The file's own header said so in
// passing — "een jsonb die geen enkele voorwaarde in de app leest" — and it stayed true.
//
// So the app read the answer off the paper, parsed it with a tested module, wrote it to the row,
// and then showed the owner two identical green buttons asking Bank or Contant. Every bon. The
// work was all there; the last wire was missing, and no gate could see it, because a write with no
// reader breaks nothing, types fine and passes every test.
//
// This is the same shape as the dropped decideFromAi fields above, one step further down the pipe:
// there a field was written and never PASSED, here it is passed and never READ. So it gets the
// same answer — a gate on the wiring itself.
