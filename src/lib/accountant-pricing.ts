// [KANTOOR-STAFFEL] The price of the boekhouder portal above the free boundary — one source for
// both the billing code and the published Terms.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// READ THIS FIRST: WHAT THIS FILE IS AND IS NOT
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is NOT an activated price. `ACCOUNTANT_PRICING_ACTIVE` is false, and while it is false the
// portal is free above the boundary too, exactly as §5.8.1 of the Terms says. Nothing here bills
// anyone. It is a PREPARED price: written down, published in the Terms as prepared-not-active, so
// an office can read what is coming before it arrives instead of being surprised by it later.
//
// It exists because the alternative was worse. The Terms previously committed to a rate "per
// gekoppelde klant per maand" — a shape, promised in public, chosen before a single office had
// been spoken to. Removing a published commitment costs nothing today and is impossible after the
// first office signs, so it was removed while it was still free to remove.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THE TERMS RENDER FROM THIS FILE
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Because they already drifted apart once. In July 2026 the published Terms quoted plans of € 25
// and € 45 while the database CHECK constraint knew a different four-tier model, and neither knew
// about the other; MARKTPOSITIE_2026.md recorded it as a stop point. Prose and constants that
// describe the same number in two places disagree eventually — not through carelessness, but
// because changing one of them is a complete-looking change.
//
// So `algemene-voorwaarden.ts` carries a `[TARIEF-STAFFEL]` token and `fillAccountantPricing()`
// replaces it with the table generated below. There is no second copy to forget. The guard is
// accountant-pricing.test.ts, which asserts the RENDERED document contains the numbers this file
// defines — so a change here that never reaches /voorwaarden fails the build.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// HOW THESE NUMBERS WERE CHOSEN — AND HOW MUCH TO TRUST THEM
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Honestly: not much, and the owner asked for them anyway, knowing that. There has been no
// conversation with an administratiekantoor. Stop points 2, 5 and 8 of MARKTPOSITIE_2026.md all
// remain open, and every one of them can move these numbers.
//
// What they ARE anchored on, with the reliability marks from that same study:
//
//   · Basecone (Wolters Kluwer)  ± € 7,50 per administratie   [unverified, partly 2017–2021]
//   · TriFact365                 € 2,50 → € 0,99 per administratie  [unverified]
//   · A2X / Link My Books        from ± $ 25–29 per channel per month  [verified, July 2026]
//   · The study's own target     "test € 150 per office per month"
//
// The bands below work out to € 1,96–€ 4,45 per linked client: above TriFact365's floor, well
// under Basecone, and the top band lands on the € 150 the study wanted tested. That is a
// defensible position between the two Dutch reference points, and it is still a guess about
// willingness to pay, not a measurement of it.
//
// WHY A BAND AND NOT A PER-CLIENT RATE. A per-client rate makes an office's bill grow in a
// straight line with its own growth, which turns every new client into a moment to reconsider the
// software. A band makes one client extra cost nothing until the office crosses into the next
// one. It is also the shape an office can predict a year ahead, which is what a fixed cost line
// has to be to stop being examined.
//
// WHY NOT ONE FLAT FEE PER OFFICE. Because an office with 11 clients and one with 60 are not the
// same customer, and a single fee either prices the small one out or leaves the large one paying
// less than it costs to serve.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// HOW TO CHANGE OR REVERT THIS
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   Change a price          edit `monthlyExclBtw` below. The Terms follow on the next build; there
//                           is nothing else to update. The test will tell you if a number failed
//                           to reach the rendered page.
//   Change the bands        edit ACCOUNTANT_BANDS. Keep it sorted and keep the last entry's
//                           `upTo: null` — that is the open-ended top band.
//   Postpone the whole      leave ACCOUNTANT_PRICING_ACTIVE false. That is the current state and
//   thing                   it is a complete, publishable state, not an unfinished one.
//   Undo it entirely        `git revert` the commit that introduced this file. It restores the
//                           previous §5.8 text verbatim, including the per-client wording.
//
// ACTIVATING is deliberately not just this flag: §5.8.1 and §5.5 promise 30 days' notice by
// e-mail, no retroactive billing, and no automatic collection without explicit confirmation.
// Flipping the flag without sending that notice breaks a published promise. The flag is the last
// step, not the first.

// [CENT] Cent rounding comes from invoice-totals.round2 and is never written again here. The
// lifecycle gate enforces that: two roundings that agree today diverge the first time one of them
// is "improved", and a price is exactly where that must not happen.
