// [BANK-BATCH-RECONCILE] Pure reconciliation of a multi-invoice bank payment.
//
// A single bank debit can pay SEVERAL invoices at once (a wholesaler batches a week of
// deliveries into one direct debit; the bank writes every invoice number in the
// reference). The card lists one slot per referenced number. The honest question the
// owner needs answered before confirming is NOT "does each amount appear in my
// statement" (it does NOT — only the SUM was debited) but "do the invoices I found add
// up to exactly what left my account".
//
// This module answers that, and ONLY asserts a tie when every referenced number has a
// matched invoice with a known amount AND their gross totals sum to the bank amount to
// the cent. Anything short of that is reported honestly as a mismatch or as incomplete
// (some invoices not yet in the administration) — never a false green.
//

// [BANK-PSP-MATCH] Which of the invoice numbers we KNOW does this payment actually reference?
//
// This is the ONLY safe signal for "is this a genuine multi-invoice batch?". A PSP / order
// gateway (Mollie, webshop) writes a transaction hash + an order number in the remittance, so
// the reference has several fragments even though ZERO of them are invoice numbers. Counting
// fragments alone (the old bug) forced the slot view and hid a real amount-matched invoice.
// Counting FULL-amount candidates instead (the second bug an adversarial review caught) let an
// UNRELATED invoice that happened to equal the whole debit collapse a genuine batch and
// auto-select the wrong invoice. Resolving against real invoice numbers avoids both.
//
// [BUNDEL-REF-RECOVER] It reads the DESCRIPTION as well as the reference, and that is the whole
// point. `reference` is what extractInvoiceReference could carve out of the remittance, and its
// token regex cuts a number at every separator and drops a leading year as "a bare year":
//     "2026-045, 2026-046"  →  reference "045, 046"
//     "F-1001, F-1002"      →  reference "1001, 1002"
// Both are then unmatchable — "045" is below the 4-char safety floor, and "1001" is not the
// invoice's number ("F-1001"). So for every owner whose invoices are NOT on the app's default
// {year}{seq} template — which is EVERY supplier invoice, since the supplier numbers those —
// the app could not recognise the bundled payment IT asked the owner to make. Matching the
// invoice's own number against the full text with referenceMatches' whole-token rules recovers
// it: the raw "2026-045" is still in the description, and normalizeRef makes the separator
// irrelevant. The 4-char floor stays (a 3-digit "045" can never be identified safely).

//     (a debit pays purchases, a credit pays sales) — zero matches OR an ambiguous number aborts,
//   • no invoice used for two references, and all invoices from ONE supplier (block a coincidental
//     cross-vendor sum-tie),
//   • the matched gross totals sum to the bank amount TO THE CENT (reconcileBatch "ties").

// ─── [BANK-SUM-SUGGEST] Same-supplier sum WITHOUT quoted numbers — a suggestion, never a booking ──
//
// The realistic gap this closes: a customer (or the owner, paying a supplier) transfers the sum
// of two or three open invoices in ONE payment and writes nothing usable in the description.
// No reference → resolveBatchNumbers finds nothing; no single invoice equals the amount → the
// matcher scores every pair below the floor. Outcome 'none': a payment that is EXACTLY the sum
// of open invoices from EXACTLY that counterparty renders as "Geen factuur", and the owner
// reconstructs the arithmetic by hand.
//
// Why this is a SUGGESTION and can never auto-book: a sum-tie without a printed number is
// arithmetic coincidence made likelier by combinatorics — with enough open invoices, SOME subset
// sums to almost anything. Every guard here narrows that space, and the human still confirms
// each invoice through the normal guarded path:
//   · the counterparty must IDENTIFY: strong name identity or the invoice's own IBAN — a bare
//     amount coincidence across suppliers never enters the pool;
//   · only fully-usable open balances (positive; a creditnota in the mix makes the arithmetic
//     ambiguous by sign);
//   · subsets of 2..4 invoices, pool capped at 12 — beyond that the tie proves nothing;

//     (which one would it be?);

// invoice that has not been imported yet is, by construction, invisible to it.
//
// That blind spot booked money wrongly. A real ATAPACK payment of €2.265,41 carried the description
// "Tweede deel factuur 26302050 , factuur 26302362". Only the first invoice was in the books, so
// exactly one number resolved, the multi-invoice slot view never appeared (it needs two), and the
// card offered to book the WHOLE payment as a deelbetaling on invoice 26302050 — which had room for
// it, being €4.662,80 open. The second invoice would then arrive with its money already spent: it
// stays fully open, it is dunned, and the owner can pay it a second time.
//
// The card even contradicted itself while doing so: its "2 facturen" badge counts resolved numbers
// PLUS unresolved leftovers, and it sat directly above a single-invoice chooser that only renders
// when the payment is NOT considered multi-invoice.
//
// So this reads the other side of the evidence: not "do we have it?" but "does the payment SAY it
// is an invoice?". The word in front of the number is what makes that a fact rather than a guess.
