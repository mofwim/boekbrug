// [REGIME-FLAGS] The ONE I/O collector shared by /api/readiness, /api/aangifte and the closing
// package, so all three detect the same regimes from the same evidence and never disagree. It
// fetches the owner's invoice line texts (phrase source) and hands them to the pure
// detectRegimeFlags. Kept out of regime-flags.ts so that module stays pure + node-testable.

 * hiccup yields no phrase flags, never a crash) — the KOR flags don't depend on lines anyway.
