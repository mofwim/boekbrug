// [BOEK-032] Account data export (GDPR) — builds a ZIP of the user's own data.
//
// Server-only. Bundles:
//   facturen.csv          → all invoices (user as sender or receiver), via export.ts
//   btw-aangiftes.csv     → every FILED quarter, frozen as declared (see [EXPORT-FILED]); when
//                           that ledger could not be read, a NIET-GELEZEN note replaces it
//   bestanden/...         → the user's actual Storage files (bucket "documents")
//   profiel.json          → the user's profile record (verbatim)
//   manifest.json         → summary + any skipped files (transparency pillar)
//
// Ownership: this file is owned by [BOEK-032]. export.ts is owned by B.14/B.20 —
// we CALL its helpers (toExportRowFull, invoicesToCsv); we never modify it.
//
// Security: the caller (api/account/delete) MUST pass a userId taken from a
// VERIFIED session. The pipeline (service_role) client bypasses RLS, so every
// query here is explicitly scoped to that userId (handoff lesson 3).

 * register, the price list, the hours, the vehicles, the reminder trail, and the links that say
 * which bank payment settled which invoice.
 *
 * That is not a smaller export, it is a different claim. facturen.csv carries a total and a client
 * NAME; the lines that make up that total, and the address and btw-nummer the invoice was actually
 * addressed to, live in invoice_lines and clients. An owner who leaves BoekBrug with this ZIP can
 * see WHAT was invoiced and to whom by name, and can reconstruct nothing — not one invoice, not
 * one reconciliation. The bewaarplicht that manifest.json hands back to them (art. 52 AWR, seven
 * years) is a duty to keep an administration that can be inspected, and headers are not one.
 *
 * It matters more than it looks because /api/account/delete GATES deletion on this export having
 * been made and confirmed. So the app's own answer to "take your data and go" was the incomplete
 * file, and taking it was the step that unlocked destroying the rest.
 *
 * Everything here is keyed on user_id, except invoice_lines, which hangs off the owner's invoices.
 * Verbatim JSON like the ledgers above: a column added later still leaves with the account.

  // movement has no source document to re-read — the owner typed it. So the audit row is the only
