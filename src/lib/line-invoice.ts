// src/lib/line-invoice.ts
// [REGEL-FACTUUR] An invoice from a bank line, with no file. Pure, no I/O.
// Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/line-invoice.test.ts
//
// Every door that adds an invoice from /bank read a FILE. The owner who knows exactly what a
// payment was — the supplier who never sends a bill, the receipt that went through the wash, the
// cash sale a customer paid by transfer — had two options: upload something they do not have, or
// ignore the line and lose it from every figure. This is the third: say what it was, and the line
// books as that.
//
// The one rule that makes this honest is the btw rule, and it differs by direction:
//   · money OUT (a purchase): without an invoice there is NO voorbelasting — art. 15 Wet OB needs
//     an invoice that meets art. 35a; a bank line does not. The cost still deducts for the income
//     tax (a bank line with the supplier's name is enough evidence there). So a purchase booked
//     without a document carries btw 0, whatever rate the supplier uses, and the row says why.
//     Only when the owner declares the document exists elsewhere (paper, a mailbox) may a rate be
//     applied — and then the row is flagged so the document can still be attached later.
//   · money IN (a sale): btw is OWED on revenue whether or not an invoice was issued. A sale booked
//     from a bank line carries the rate the owner names, default 21.
