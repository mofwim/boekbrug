// [SUPPLIER-IBAN] Pure node test — run: npx tsx --test src/lib/supplier-iban.test.ts
//
// The matcher's IBAN tier reads the account printed on THAT invoice. That field is null far more
// often than the supplier is unknown — a footer the extractor never reached, an invoice that
// arrived before the supplier existed in the registry — and in every one of those cases the app has
// known the account all along and no matcher asked.
//
// The shape this unlocks is the one that was unbookable by construction: an MT940 line with a
// counterpart IBAN, no invoice number, and no counterparty name. 'certain' had nothing to match;
// 'amount_only' had no name to require.
//
// What is held here is that the new evidence is weighed HONESTLY: below the document's own IBAN,
// booked flagged and never silent, ignored where the document already answered, and refused when
// the one weakness it has — a supplier resolved by a colliding name key — is showing.
