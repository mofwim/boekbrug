// src/lib/e-invoice.ts
// [E-FACTUUR] The supplier's own figures, in machine form. No AI, no OCR, no reading of a picture.
// Run: npx tsx --test src/lib/e-invoice.test.ts
//
// ── WHY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS IN THE APP ──
// Everything else this import does to be sure of a number is a way of checking a READING:
//
//   · the arithmetic gate compares three figures one read produced;
//   · field_confidence is the model's opinion of its own answer;
//   · [GEGROND] asks whether the figure occurs in the document's own characters;
//   · [DOCCHECK] asks whether it sits where a total is printed;
//   · the OCR pass is a second reading, with different failure modes.
//
// An e-invoice is not a reading at all. Factur-X and ZUGFeRD are ordinary-looking PDFs that carry
// the invoice a second time as XML attached inside the file; a Peppol/UBL invoice is that XML on
// its own. Either way the supplier states the totals in a structured form THEY produced. There is
// nothing to interpret, and no picture in between.
//
// The app could not see any of it. A Factur-X PDF was photographed by the model like any other
// page while the exact figures sat unread inside the same bytes.
//
// ── AND IT MATTERS MORE EVERY YEAR — BUT NOT ON THE DATE THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM ──
//
// What stood here was: "The Netherlands makes Peppol e-invoicing mandatory for businesses over
// €800k turnover from 1 January 2027, and for everyone — zzp included — from 1 January 2028."
//
// That is not true, and the way it became "true" is worth writing down, because it will happen
// again. One session wrote it from an unnamed source; a later session read it in this file and
// cited it back as a fact about the world, and a strategy was proposed on top of it. A claim does
// not become verified by being committed. Checked against the actual record (August 2026):
//
//   · B2G — real and long-standing. Suppliers to the Dutch national government have invoiced
//     electronically over Peppol since 2017. That is the only Dutch e-invoicing OBLIGATION today.
//   · Domestic B2B — NOT law, and not yet even a bill. ViDA lets a member state mandate it; the
//     Netherlands is consulting. Cabinet clarity on scope was due summer 2026, a draft bill goes
//     to consultation in Q4 2026, and the legislation is to be ADOPTED by mid-2028 — which is
//     almost certainly where the "2028" in the deleted sentence came from. Adoption is not entry
//     into force.
//   · Cross-border B2B — 1 July 2030 under ViDA. That is the first hard EU date.
//
// So the honest version: the direction is certain, the deadline is roughly four years further out
// than this file claimed, and NOTHING here should be justified by urgency.
//
// It does not need to be. The reason this code pays for itself TODAY has nothing to do with Dutch
// law: German suppliers send ZUGFeRD now, French ones Factur-X, Belgian ones Peppol UBL since
// January 2026 — and a Dutch buyer receives all three already. Every one of those arrives as a
// number nobody has to read off a picture. That is the whole argument, and it holds whatever the
// Belastingdienst decides in 2028.
//
// Sources: Kamerbrief "Kabinetsreactie op het rapport ViDA e-facturatie en digitale rapportage"
// (tweedekamer.nl, 2026Z04773); EY advisory report on the Dutch implementation; peppol.nl on
// country-specific obligations. Re-check before quoting: this is a moving file.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT DO ──
// It finds the XML and reads the money out of it. It does not validate against EN 16931, does not
// check Schematron, does not care about line items, and it refuses anything it cannot read
// completely and consistently — a half-parsed e-invoice is worth less than no e-invoice, because
// it would be trusted.
//
// Both syntaxes are supported because both occur: CII (Factur-X / ZUGFeRD / XRechnung) and UBL
// (Peppol / NLCIUS). They are two spellings of the same European semantic model, and an importer
// that knows only one fails SILENTLY on the other — the totals simply are not where it looked.

 * ── WHY THIS PREDICATE HAD TO EXIST ──
 * Everything this app does to be sure of an amount guards ONE risk: the reading might be wrong.
 * The arithmetic gate compares three figures one read produced. field_confidence is the model's
 * opinion of its own answer. [GEGROND] asks whether the figure occurs in the document's own
 * characters. [DOCCHECK] asks whether it sits where a total is printed. The OCR pass is a second
 * reading. Five ways of asking "did we read this right?".
 *
 * When a complete, self-consistent e-invoice is present and AGREES with the read, that risk is
 * gone. Not reduced — gone. The supplier stated the number in a form with nothing to interpret,
 * and the read matches it to the cent. Continuing to hold such an invoice out of the queue because
 * the MODEL was only 0.72 sure of a number the SUPPLIER already stated is guarding a doubt that no
 * longer exists.
 *
 * That was the shape of the mistake: the strongest witness in the building was wired in as a sixth
 * check on the reading instead of as a replacement for it. This turns it into the answer.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SETTLE ──
 * Only the money. parseEInvoice reads totals, not what KIND of document this is. A statement, a
 * reminder and a creditnota can all carry perfectly valid XML, and each of those still needs a
 * human — so every gate about the document's kind, about duplicates, and about the vendor, number
 * and date stays exactly where it was. This narrows one axis; it does not open a door.
 *
 * ── AND IT FAILS CLOSED, LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND IT ──
 * No e-invoice → false. Unreadable or incomplete XML → parseEInvoice already refused it, so the
 * row carries nothing and this is false. Contradiction → false, and the contradiction keeps its
 * own, stronger refusal elsewhere. There is no input to this function that turns absence of

  // the strength of that same XML would be using the supplier's file to wave through the one
  // document whose SIGN it just told us is inverted. Magnitude is not the question on a credit
  // note; direction is, and this function has no opinion about direction.

  // eInvoiceOf normalises with `=== true`, which is right for a gate that only acts on `true`: a
  // missing or malformed value must not BLOCK anything. Here the direction is reversed — this
  // function GRANTS — and the same normalisation would turn `contradicts: "nee"`, or any other
  // corrupted value, into a clean bill of health. A test written for the opposite reason found it.
  //
  // So the raw value is read again, and only two shapes settle anything:
  //   absent  — an older row, read before the comparison was stored. The reader has written this
  //             field on every extraction since; absent means the question predates the field, not
  //             that it was dodged.
  //   false   — the comparison ran and the figures agreed.
  // Anything else is a value we do not understand, and a value we do not understand is a doubt.
