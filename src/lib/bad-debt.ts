//
//   lid 1 (detectBadDebt)     — a SALES invoice your customer never paid: the BTW you declared on
//                               it comes BACK to you. Money to get.
//   lid 7 (detectVatClawback) — a PURCHASE invoice you never paid: the voorbelasting you deducted
//                               goes BACK to the Belastingdienst. Money to give.
//
// They are the same rule read from two sides, so they live in one module and share the clock, the
// creditnota reversal logic and the kasstelsel guard. Only the second one is a liability, and that
// is the one an entrepreneur never hears about until the naheffing arrives.
//
// Dutch rule (Art. 29 Wet OB, sinds 2017): a receivable is presumed uncollectible ONE YEAR after
// its payment due date if still unpaid. The BTW you earlier declared + paid on that invoice may
// then be reclaimed (a reduction of de verschuldigde BTW). This module DETECTS eligible invoices
// and totals the reclaimable BTW — it never books it: whether a debt is truly uncollectible, and
// in which period to reclaim, is the owner's/accountant's call (and if the customer later pays,
// the BTW must be re-declared). So this is an honest FLAG, never an automatic figure.
//
// Applies ONLY to factuurstelsel: under kasstelsel BTW is due on payment, so an unpaid invoice
// never had its BTW declared — there is nothing to reclaim.

/**
 * [DEEL-CREDIT] How much has been credited against each original, incl. btw, as a positive amount.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS REPLACED A Set<string> ──
 *
 * Both detectors below used to build `creditedOriginalIds` and skip any invoice that appeared in
 * it, on the reasoning — written into the comment there — that "a creditnota FULLY reverses its
 * original". That was true of every creditnota this app could make, right up until
 * creditnota_partial.sql made a credit for one disputed LINE possible. After that, one € 121
 * credit on a € 1.210 invoice switched the whole rule off, and it did so on both sides:
 *
 *   lid 1, the money to GET: the customer never paid the remaining € 1.089, a year passed, and the
 *     owner may reclaim the BTW on it. Measured: € 189 reclaimable, € 0 reported. Silently — a
 *     reclaim that is never offered is never missed.
 *
 *   lid 7, the money to GIVE: the same shape on a purchase invoice removed the warning entirely.
 *     That is the worse half, and this module's own header says why: it is "the only art. 29 side
 *     that costs money", the one "an entrepreneur never hears about until the naheffing arrives".
 *     A single partial supplier credit turned the alarm off.
 *
 * The credited portion needs no reclaim and no repayment of its own: the creditnota carries
 * NEGATIVE btw and was declared in its own period, so that BTW is already back where it belongs.
 * What is left is exactly the unpaid remainder, which is what the fraction below now measures.
