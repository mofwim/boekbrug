# Money-path audit — August 2026

_A measured inventory of every module that touches an amount: what is proven, what is guarded but
not proven, and what is neither. Written because the product is about to be priced at € 49–149 per
office per month, and a bookkeeping app that is wrong about money is worse than no bookkeeping app._

**Method.** Every module under `src/lib` that mentions an amount, btw, a cent, a commission or a
settlement was classified by two facts that can be measured rather than judged: does a test import
it, and does it perform I/O. Nothing here is an impression of code quality.

---

## 1. The headline

**The arithmetic is unusually well guarded. The assembly around it is not.**

The pure engines that compute money are tested to a standard well above what this price point
implies. Every module that turns those engines into what a user sees talks to the database, has no
pure seam, and is therefore covered by source-level gates or by nothing.

That is not a new discovery — `RECONCILIATION_TRIANGLE.md` already says it: _"the pure engines are
unit-tested, but a live upload → DB → `/api/result` pass is the final proof."_ What this audit adds
is the size of it: **roughly 2,300 lines of money-carrying assembly with no behavioural test.**

## 2. Layer 1 — the pure engines: proven

| Module | Assertions |
|---|---|
| `triangle.ts` | 40 |
| `statement-reconcile.ts` | 36 |
| `turnover.ts` | 37 |
| `card-reconcile.ts` | 33 |
| `ubl-export.ts` | 31 |
| `draft-totals.ts` | 27 |
| `invoice-discount.ts` | 27 |
| `bank-statement-balance.ts` | 27 |
| `snelstart-mapping.ts` | 25 |
| `vat-scheme.ts` | 16 |
| `invoice-totals.ts` | 15 |
| `bank-reconciliation.ts` | 15 |
| `btw-reconcile.ts` | 14 |

Beyond the counts, three structural guards are worth naming because they catch the class of defect
that unit tests miss:

- **`[CENT]`** — cent rounding may exist in exactly one place (`invoice-totals.round2`). It was
  written after five different rounding implementations produced a ledger saying 4,52 and an
  e-invoice XML saying 4.51 on the same line. It fired twice during this audit's own work and was
  right both times.
- **The refusal principle** — the system blocks rather than guesses: an unknown btw rate stops an
  import instead of defaulting. For an office carrying the liability, this is the actual product.
- **`WAARHEID_AUDIT_2026-07.md`** — a dedicated review of `/dashboard/waarheid` found 15 defects,
  6 of them critical, including two of exactly the feared kind: _"the two engines disagreed on what
  a card payout is"_ and _"a failed PIN-ledger read made the reconciliation look cleaner than it
  was"_. **All 15 are marked fixed**, each with the mechanism named.

## 3. Layer 2 — the assembly: guarded at best

Every module below carries money and is reached by **no importing test**, because each performs
I/O against Supabase and has no pure seam to assert on. "Gates" are source-level assertions in
`lifecycle-gates.test.ts` — they pin structure, not behaviour.

| Module | Lines | Gates | What rides on it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compute-result-range.ts` | 485 | 1 | The reconcile engine over an arbitrary window — behind `/dashboard/waarheid` and the result screens |
| `incasso-settle.ts` | 415 | 3 | Direct-debit settlement |
| `cash-settle.ts` | 414 | 3 | Cash settlement |
| `btw-rate-split-fetch.ts` | 153 | 0 | Splitting turnover across btw rates |
| `bad-debt-collect.ts` | 153 | 0 | Bad-debt relief |
| `vat-exemption-collect.ts` | 147 | 0 | Exemption handling |
| `turnover-book.ts` | 126 | 0 | Booking the day's turnover |
| `bank-recon-map.ts` | 104 | 0 | Mapping reconciliation results |
| `bank-auto-categorize.ts` | 99 | 0 | Learned categories applied to bank lines |
| `regime-collect.ts` | 72 | 0 | btw regime resolution |

`bank-auto-confirm.ts` (4 gates), `fair-use-gate.ts` (3), `bank-ingest.ts` (2), `bank-tx-links.ts`
(1) are in the same category with more structural cover.

**The concentration worth naming:** `compute-result-range.ts` is 485 lines, sits behind the screen
called _"je financiële waarheid"_, and has one source gate and no behavioural test. It is the single
largest untested money surface in the repo.

## 4. What was fixed during this audit

**`plan.ts` — the offer a buyer reads at the moment of commitment.** The only pure money-facing
module in `src/lib` with no test file. It is 85 lines of strings, which is exactly why it was
skipped, and exactly why it matters: `OFFER_NL` is pasted wherever someone is asked to bind
themselves, and the checkout makes them accept the Terms in the same flow. Its own header records
the defect it was built to prevent — the billing branch carried `priceLabel: "€ 12,00"` while the
binding terms published € 12,99, and ambiguity in your own general terms is construed against you.
Now tested (`plan.test.ts`, 7 tests): every amount must be derived, both offer sentences must quote
the same figure, no euro amount may appear that is not a published price, the three trust promises
must survive, and the inactive accountant band must never be advertised as live.

**`bank-ingest.ts` — a spreadsheet dropped on the bank importer.** Carried as "latent" in
`RECONCILIATION_TRIANGLE.md`. The path already detected the spreadsheet and told the owner, by
name, to import it via Dagomzet — then stored it anyway as `doc_type: "bankafschrift"`, `shared:
true`, **with its `content_hash`**. The owner follows the advice, uploads the same bytes to
Dagomzet, and byte-hash dedup rejects them as already seen. The app pointed at the right door and
locked it on the way past. Nothing errors; the day's turnover simply never arrives, the file is
filed as something it is not, and the boekhouder sees a kassa export in the bank section of
`/brug`. Fixed: no storage row, no hash claimed, nothing shared. Guarded by
`[SHEET-NIET-OPSLAAN]`, which was verified to fail when the fix is reverted.

## 5. The real risk is coverage, not correctness

`eft-parser.ts` normalises **one** acquirer format: Equens CTAP _"TOTALEN RAPPORT / EIND TOTALEN"_.

An office whose clients use CCV, Worldline, Mplus, Lightspeed or unTill gets nothing today. The
failure in the first sales conversation will therefore not be "your figures are wrong" — the
figures are the strongest part of this repo. It will be **"my files do not go in"**.

`MARKTPOSITIE_2026.md` stop point 6 states the test exactly: collect 10 real Z-reports and 10
terminal settlements from 10 businesses; if fewer than 6 parse without new code, this is a service
(route D), not a product. That remains the single most informative thing that can be done, and it
needs real files, not more code.

## 6. What would close the remaining gaps, in order of value

1. **A live `upload → DB → /api/result` pass.** The proof `RECONCILIATION_TRIANGLE.md` names as
   final and that no amount of unit testing substitutes for. Needs a running Supabase.
   _(2 September 2026: the instrument now exists — `scripts/verify-live-chain.mts`, §16. The
   measurement still has not been taken; this item stays open until someone runs it.)_
2. **A pure seam in `compute-result-range.ts`.** Extract the windowing and aggregation from the
   fetching, the way `truth-lens.ts` was extracted during the July audit — the same move, on the
   larger module, with the same payoff.
3. **Broaden `eft-parser.ts`.** Blocked on real settlement files; cannot be invented.
4. **Behavioural tests for `cash-settle` / `incasso-settle`** (829 lines between them), which will
   likely need the same extraction as (2) first.
   _(2 September 2026: closed — §18. The extraction was indeed needed, and it was assembly rather
   than I/O that had been mistaken for untestable.)_

## 7. The honest verdict

For € 49–149 per office per month, the arithmetic is defensible today and better than the market
study credits: the daily close is a real screen, `card-reconcile` is wired into `turnover.ts`,
`triangle.ts` and `compute-result-range.ts`, and every pure engine behind it is tested.

Two things are not yet true, and neither is hidden in this repo — both were already written down
before this audit and are confirmed by it. The system has never been proven end-to-end against a
live database, and it reads one acquirer format. The first is a day of work with credentials. The
second is ten real files away, and no more code will substitute for them.

---

## 8. Re-measured, 30 August 2026 — §6 items 2 and 4 worked, by the same method

Same two questions as §0: does a test import it, and does it perform I/O. Nothing below is an
impression.

**§6 item 2 was already done.** `result-range-assemble.ts` exists (459 lines, 17 tests) and
`compute-result-range.ts` is down to 268 lines. The extraction this audit asked for happened in
commit 8b90230, which named the problem exactly: _"The engine behind 'je financiële waarheid' had
no behavioural test, and could not have one."_

**§6 item 4 splits in two, and one half was reachable.** The I/O halves of `cash-settle.ts` and
`incasso-settle.ts` still need a database. But the *decisions* they carry do not, and those were
the untested part that mattered:

| Decision | Where | What a wrong answer does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `belongsToIncassoSupplier` | `incasso-settle.ts` | books an invoice nobody paid |
| `incassoClientKey` | `incasso-settle.ts` | the idempotency lock; an unstable key double-books |
| `pnlRole` / `categoryLabel` | `bank-categories.ts` | sends a confirmed bank line to the wrong side of the P&L, or nowhere |
| quarter boundary | `snelstart-queue` vs `kasboek` | puts a euro in the wrong btw-aangifte |
| `buildPaymentLinkRows` | `bank-tx-links.ts` | a NULL `amount_applied` re-opens a settled invoice at its full total |

The last one needed the same extraction as item 2, on a module this audit did not list:
`bank-tx-links.ts` writes the rows `invoices.amount_paid` is derived from, and everything in it
did I/O except that single decision. It is `buildPaymentLinkRows` now — same logic, testable.

Each of the five was verified by breaking it and watching the new test fail: a drifted quarter end,
a weakened amount guard, a removed honesty line. A test that has never failed has not been shown to
work.

**What this did NOT change, and the reason to be careful reading it.** Two claims in §5 and §7
stand untouched, and they are the two that matter commercially:

* the system has still never been proven end-to-end against a live database;
* `eft-parser.ts` still reads one acquirer format.

Neither is a coverage problem and neither is closed by more tests. §6 items 1 and 3 remain exactly
as written.

**One correction to how §5 reads.** "The real risk is coverage, not correctness" is right about the
assembly and misleading about the whole. Coverage here is not organised by module: it lives in
source-level gates in `lifecycle-gates.test.ts` and in files named after the GUARD rather than the
module — `credit-backstop.test.ts` and `ex-incl-fix.test.ts` test functions that live in `ai.ts`,
which itself has no `ai.test.ts`. Counting test files per module therefore understates it. Three of
the modules that looked untested on that count turned out to be covered, and one file written on
that assumption had to be deleted again. Measure by "which decision is asserted", not by "which
file has a neighbour".

---

## 9. The four defects the adversarial pass found, closed 31 August 2026

§8 measured the *coverage* gap. This section is the other kind of finding: places where the code
was wrong, not merely unwatched. All four came out of a fan-out audit over the money path whose
findings were then verified one at a time against production data before a line was changed —
because a plausible finding that nobody checked is how an audit starts costing more than it saves.

Two of the four are gone. Two were real in shape and reachable by nobody today; both are recorded
here as *measured*, not as *dismissed*.

| # | Where | What it did | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | `auto-incasso.ts` | an auto-collection the owner reversed was re-booked within the hour, forever | **fixed** |
| B | `cash-settle.ts` | a failed read was misread as "the column is gone", deleting real cash movements | **fixed** |
| C | `cash-settle.ts` | an unreadable invoice direction is guessed, silently | **guess kept, now reported** |
| D | `cron/reconcile` | an owner who paid only part in cash was invisible to the hourly pass | **fixed** |

**A — the undo that did not survive the hour.** The idempotency key is derived from the invoice and
its vervaldatum, so it is identical on every run. But it is *stored* in the `bank_tx_invoices` row,
and the undo deletes that row — so the correction removed the very record that made the booking
unrepeatable. Nothing in the undo path knew what an incasso was; nothing in the settle path read
the marker it writes itself. `amount_paid` is clamped, so the books stayed self-consistent while
asserting a payment that never happened, and under the kasstelsel the restored `payment_date`
decided the quarter — voorbelasting claimed on money that never left the account.

**B — the probe that could not tell two things apart.** Documented in full in its own commit. The
short version: `settlement_id` exists in production, so the deploy window the fallback was written
for has closed, and every `false` the probe could still return was a false one — each costing two
hard-deleted cash movements and a third re-dated across a possible quarter end.

**C — why the guess stays.** Refusing to guess is worse than guessing here, and that is worth
writing down so nobody "fixes" it later: `computeCashSettlementSync` deletes every linked entry
whose invoice is absent from the paid set, so dropping an invoice with an unreadable direction
would *remove* a real cash movement rather than merely mis-sign it. The column is nullable with no
default and no check constraint, and is clean today — 605 invoices, 586 incoming, 19 outgoing, not
one null. The report is what will say the day that changes.

**D — the hole in the safety net.** "Who has cash to reconcile" is a definition written once and
spelled twice; the second spelling, in the cron, had only half of it. The half it lost was exactly
the case the cron exists for — the owner whose synchronous reconcile failed and who therefore has
no drawer entry to be discovered by.

### What this changes about §5 and §7

Nothing in §7. The verdict there is about the arithmetic and it still holds; none of these four was
an arithmetic error. All four were the same shape, and it is the shape §5 predicted: **a decision
taken correctly in one place and not read in another.** A key that is stable but stored where an
undo deletes it. A probe whose two possible failures mean opposite things. A definition spelled
twice. That is the assembly layer, not the engines — which is precisely where §3 said the risk was.

§6 items 1 and 3 remain open and are still not closable from here: one needs a live database pass,
the other needs real acquirer files.

---

## 10. One signature, hunted deliberately — 31 August 2026

§9 ended on the observation that all four defects shared a shape: **not an arithmetic error, but a
decision taken correctly in one place and not read in another.** That is a searchable signature, so
this pass searched for it on purpose rather than asking again for "bugs" — one seam class per
reader (idempotency keys, markers, definitions spelled twice, capability probes, undo paths,
coercions, rounding, period assignment, truncation, owner scoping), each finding then put to three
independent skeptics instructed to refute.

The refute rate is the useful number: **most findings did not survive.** Nothing below is included
because an agent asserted it.

### Fixed, each verified against production before a line was changed

| What | Where | Why it was the signature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A reversed auto-incasso re-booked hourly | `auto-incasso.ts` | the idempotency key was stable, and stored in the row the undo deletes |
| "Opnieuw inlezen" erased the guard for it | `reimport-carry.ts` | the marker that replaced the key was not on the carry allow-list |
| Four more probes read "busy" as "column gone" | `column-probe.ts` | one question, five spellings, five copies of one bug |
| € 5.321,68 of phantom discrepancy | `money-invariants.ts` | the write path was fixed; the rows it left were not |
| Three audit checks that could never fire | `scripts/money-audit.ts` | the checks were right; the caller fed them two columns short |
| Auto-collected AND dunned, on the same invoice | `cron/payment-due` | "which supplier collects this?" was spelled twice, and the spellings disagree |
| A slow query moved cash payments into the wrong BTW quarter | `kas-payment-events-fetch.ts` | the probe defect a sixth time, wearing a try/catch instead of a boolean |
| The board warned about a link the owner made by hand | `bank/unlink`, `bank/confirm` | a marker with one writer, one clearer, and two paths that should have cleared it |
| Two reads that said "nothing here" before finishing | `verkoop/page.tsx`, `incoming/missing` | a recovery written, argued for, and unreachable because the read never threw |

The payment-due one is the sharpest of the set, because the disagreement is
load-bearing in both directions: `belongsToIncassoSupplier` falls through to the
supplier's name key — deliberately, since that is what reaches invoices imported
before the supplier registry existed — while the reminder ladder matched on
`supplier_id` alone. An invoice in that gap is collected by the bank *and* claimed
by the ladder, and the route's own comment already said what that costs: "de
eigenaar maakt dan een tweede keer over en moet dat bij zijn leverancier
terugvragen." Two invoices were sitting in it.

The probe cluster is worth reading as the lesson. I fixed ONE of them by hand, wrote it up, and the
signature-hunt then found the same eight lines in four more files — including one whose own
`[NO-SILENT-EMPTY]` comment forbids exactly the outcome its probe produced, and which defended the
read one line *below* the probe that gates it. A rule guarded by a hand-written list is not
guarded; a rule with five spellings is five rules.

### Verified and NOT fixed, with the reason

**The turnover import can overwrite a day the owner already claimed.** `daySourceConflict`
(`till-day.ts:296`) is the guard for "one day, one source". It has exactly two readers — both manual
doors (`till/sale`, `turnover/day`). The single writer, `turnover-book.ts:105`, upserts on
`(user_id, turnover_date)` without consulting it; `till-book.ts:95` says so in its own comment. So a
Z-report import can claim a day that already carries hand-entered cash `omzet` rows, and the
covered-day rule then skips those rows as presumed duplicates — the hand-entered turnover leaves the
books silently.

Structure verified here (two readers, one writer, and the writer's own admission). Not fixed for two
reasons, both worth stating rather than quietly deferring: it needs a product decision (should an
import refuse such a day, warn, or merge — and what does the owner see?), and another session was
editing this exact area the same night, including the covered-day rule itself. A collision in cash
accounting bought nothing that waiting does not.

**A concurrent partial creditnota can pass a gross-only database guard.** Three skeptics
independently traced this end to end: `creditnota_partial.sql:40` drops the unique index that
serialised this path, and the replacement trigger sums document totals rather than per-line
quantities, while the per-line ceiling is enforced in the route between a read and an insert. Two
simultaneous requests for the same line both land.

Carried here on skeptic agreement, NOT on my own end-to-end reading, and that distinction is the
point of writing it down. It also needs a migration, and a migration against a production database
while nobody is awake is not a thing to do on an agent's say-so.

### For the owner, not for the code

The revived duplicate check finds **eleven groups of live purchase invoices** sharing a supplier and
an invoice number modulo punctuation — one of them three copies — including the pair the check was
written for: `26/1876` and `26 / 1876`, same date, same € 665,02, both paid.

Ten of the eleven were created between 5 and 19 July, and `possible-duplicate-collect.ts` landed on
19 August. So they are residue and not a detector failure — the detector did not miss them, it did
not exist. Each surviving copy counts its total into kosten and its BTW into voorbelasting a second
time, so this is real exposure and not a display problem. Nothing was touched: which of two invoices
is the real one is a judgement about somebody's administration, and §6's rule holds.

### Still open from this pass, in the order I would take them

Each survived three skeptics. None has been changed, and the reason differs:

1. **A concurrent partial creditnota passes a gross-only database guard**
   (`creditnota_partial.sql:74`). Needs a migration; not something to apply to a
   production database on an agent's own judgement.
2. **An undone bank booking is re-made within the hour** (`bank/unlink`). The same
   defect as the auto-incasso one, and the module header's promise — "fully
   reversible (owner can unlink)" — is what it breaks. Needs a design choice
   (a new column, or overloading `auto_match_reason`) with effects on the readiness
   board, and `bank-auto-confirm.ts` was being edited by another session the same
   night.
3. **A turnover import can claim a day the owner already filled by hand**
   (`turnover-book.ts:105`). Verified structurally: `daySourceConflict` has two
   readers, both manual doors, and the single writer consults neither. Needs a
   product decision about what the owner sees.
4. **The filed aangifte rounds once where the concept rounds per rubriek**
   (`aangifte/route.ts:465`), producing a €1 phantom suppletie prompt on an
   unchanged return.
5. **An ignored bank line keeps counting in the P&L** (`bank/ignore`). Marking a
   duplicate 'dubbel' hides it from the matcher and leaves its cost in kosten and
   its BTW in voorbelasting.

The pattern across everything fixed tonight is worth keeping in front of whoever
picks these up: **not one was an arithmetic error.** Every single one was a fact
established correctly in one place and not read in another — a key stored where an
undo deletes it, a marker not on a carry list, a definition spelled twice, a
recovery path that could not be reached, a probe whose two failures mean opposite
things. The engines were never the risk. The seams are.

## 11. A second pass, in parallel — 31 August 2026

Written by a session working alongside §10, on the same night. It found no arithmetic error either,
and that is now two independent passes reaching the same conclusion by different routes.

The shape here was slightly different from §10's. Where that pass hunted one signature — a fact
established in one place and not read in another — this one kept running into a second: **a check
that could not fire.** A guard that answers "fine" to every input is not a weak guard, it is the
reason nobody looks any more.

### Fixed, each verified against production before a line was changed

**A dollar statement was booked as euros, on both doors that write bank transactions.**
`bank-ingest` has refused non-euro statements from the start, reading `parsed.currency` — and
`parseBankCsv` wrote the literal `"EUR"` into that field for every file it parsed, whatever the
file's own Munt/Valuta/Currency column said. The refusal could not fire for a single CSV. The bank
FEED (Enable Banking, whose own sample data is Danish) had no check at all, and that is the worse
door: it runs on a cron with nobody watching. `bank_transactions` has no currency column, so a
foreign line stored as a number is thereafter indistinguishable from euros. Also closed for CAMT,
which carries `Ccy` per `<Ntry>` and could declare EUR at the top while holding dollar lines.

**Emptying the prullenbak could leave a booking without its bewijsstuk.** Eight foreign keys point
at `documents`; seven are `ON DELETE SET NULL` and one is `CASCADE`. The delete SUCCEEDED and took
the link with it — no error, no audit line, and afterwards no way to tell an invoice that never had
a scan from one whose scan was thrown away. The CASCADE one is worse than it looks:
`bank_statement_periods.document_id` deletes the COVERAGE record, and coverage is an input to
`computeDrawerBalance` and the financial result, so an owner could watch his kasresultaat change
because he emptied his bin. Refused now, with the reason, from inside `deleteDocument` rather than
from the route that happens to call it.

**Two iDEAL clicks at once could take a customer's payment and book nothing.** The create route
puts down a placeholder row immediately before calling Mollie; the cleanup treated every placeholder
as stranded and DELETED it. A concurrent request then handed out a checkout URL for a row that no
longer existed, the customer paid, and the webhook answered `ok: true` on an unknown row — after
which Mollie stops retrying. Money in the bank, nothing in the books, no trace. The route already
knew the right reading: its 23505 branch says an empty checkout_url means the winner is still busy.
Two places read the same sign and drew opposite conclusions.

**A second cashier ringing up mid-rebuild made the day's turnover short a whole ticket.**
`rebuildTillDay` reads a day's sales and writes an ABSOLUTE total; a ticket landing between those
two steps is lost from `daily_turnover` while staying visible in `till_sales`, so every screen still
looks right. Fixed by convergence rather than a lock — a rebuild is idempotent, which is the
module's own stated reason for rebuilding instead of applying a delta.

**Three owners were told their numbering was unbroken over numbers that were never written.**
`checkContinuity` builds its series from the invoices, so a series with no invoice has no bucket and
`burnedAtEnd` — the only check that sees the END of a series — is never computed for it.
`series.every(...)` over an empty list is `true`. Measured: two owners with a creditnota counter at
1 and 2 and zero creditnota's. The ordinary cause is a discarded draft, which is a perfectly good
answer — the owner just has to be asked before he can give it.

**A bank line the owner marked private kept its cost in kosten and its BTW in voorbelasting.**
Three of the five ignore reasons (`prive`, `dubbel`, `niet_van_mij`) are statements that the money
does not belong in the books; the route's own comment called the reason "een NOTITIE, geen besluit".
The fourth, `geen_factuur` (rent, lease, a subscription), is a real cost and MUST keep counting —
which is why this is a rule per reason and not a filter on status. The consequence now stands
visibly under both pickers, derived from the rule so the sentence cannot drift from what happens.

**The filed aangifte produced a €1 phantom suppletie on an unchanged return.** §10 item 4, closed.
The concept's 5g is the SUM of per-rubriek rounded amounts (what the paper form asks for); the
filed snapshot's raw total was rounded ONCE, with `Math.round` where the rubrieken beside it use a
symmetric rounding. The screen subtracted the two displays. The real suppletie machinery
(`computeFilingDivergence`) compared raw with raw all along and was never wrong — only the sentence
was.

**The auditfile never said which VAT scheme its dates should be read under.** It books on invoice
date, correct under both schemes — but under the kasstelsel the BTW is due in the quarter of
PAYMENT, and nothing in the file said so. The regimeNotes already declared the KOR and the undivided
0% turnover; the scheme is the only one of the three that moves the timing of everything. They also
moved from behind `</company>` to above `<auditfile>`, where a reader meets them before the figures
rather than after several thousand journal lines.

### The method, since it is the transferable part

Every one of these was verified against the production database before anything was changed, and
several turned out to be **latent** — the mechanism real, the damage not yet done. Those are said as
such rather than dressed up. Three had already fired: the three burned creditnota numbers, and
(from §10) the eleven duplicate purchase invoices.

Every gate added here was checked by deliberately reintroducing the defect and confirming it bites.
That caught four gates of mine that would have passed over the very thing they claimed to pin —
including one that looked for a report within 900 characters of a branch and found an unrelated one
further down the file, and one whose `[^)]*` could not cross a `new Date()`. A gate that reads the
wrong region reports nothing and calls itself green.

### Still open after both passes

§10's list stands, minus item 4 (closed above). Item 1 still needs a migration, item 2 a design
choice, item 3 a product decision, item 5 is closed above. Two operational items also remain and
are the owner's to do, not an agent's: applying
`supabase/migrations/accountant_amount_guard_restore.sql` (a security regression plus a mandate
tightening), and deciding what to do about the 14 invoices whose `amount_paid` is 0 while their
links cover the total exactly — `recompute_invoice_amount_paid` would repair them, but that writes
to real books.

### §11 continued — the later half of the same night

**Two doors for "mark this invoice paid" disagreed.** `/api/email/confirm`'s 'pay' action wrote the
status and not `amount_paid`; pay-toggle, the bank confirmation and the auto-confirm all write both.
Five purchase invoices sit in production as paid/bank/0/no-links. The aangifte is unaffected —
`isSettled` reads `amount_paid > 0 || status === 'paid'` precisely for legacy rows — but the money
audit reports them with a sentence describing the wrong thing.

**The money audit was crying wolf.** `btw_arithmetic` reported three live invoices as "ex 0 + btw 0
is not € 1.040,12 — dit getal staat in je aangifte", about a split the reader has not reached yet.
The check's own comment forbids exactly this ("een schending verzinnen uit een gat is hoe een audit
ophoudt geloofd te worden") and covered NULL but not zero. One genuine break exists in the books
(€ 176,40) and deserved not to be lost among three false ones.

**The three screens a return is filed from had no render coverage** — aangifte, klaar, waarheid —
which is the class AGENTS.md opens with. Verified by reintroducing that exact defect.

**Every owner was told their zelfstandigenaftrek might lapse.** All nine have zero time entries, so
all nine got the full red warning about the largest deduction a zzp'er has. urencriterium.ts's own
rule 3 draws the line this crossed: only registered hours count, and that is a statement about the
registration, "the difference between a fact and an accusation".

### Checked and found SOUND — recorded so nobody re-investigates

**The UBL creditnota flip.** `ubl-export.ts` negates quantity and line total while keeping the unit
price a magnitude, and that is correct: Peppol BIS 3.0 states a credit note's amounts positive with
type code 381, and BR-27 forbids a negative `cbc:PriceAmount`. `CR-20260002` in production has the
shape that would break a naive reading (negative quantity AND negative line total) and comes out
right. The `?? 1` default cannot express a negated line, but no invoice_line in production has a
null quantity, and the module's comment reasons about that default deliberately.

**The cash-drawer axis.** My first pass reported two owners below zero. That was my error: it summed
`cash_entries` alone, and till takings enter the drawer through `daily_turnover` without a
cash_entries row. Corrected, one owner's low point is +€59 (not −€41) and the other's is −€892,86
(not −€2.804,45). The remaining negative is real, and the app already detects it — `drawer_negative`
reports it and the filing gate blocks on it. No code defect; the owner's data has a question in it.

### One complete feature that nothing calls

`src/lib/found-money.ts` — `foundMoney()`, fully written and tested, imported by nothing. It turns
the one figure the reconciliation genuinely FINDS (the acquirer commission that was silently
inflating profit) into something an owner learns about. Its own header says why that matters: the
figure "reaches exactly one place: a stat tile on /dashboard/waarheid, alive for as long as that
screen is open", and "for an owner who does not open that screen it is work the app did that nobody
will ever learn about".

Not wired here, and the reason is the same one §10 gives for its item 3: WHERE this surfaces is a
product decision, not a wiring task. It puts a new claim about money in front of the owner, and the
module itself is careful about the framing (MARKTPOSITIE_2026.md §5: lead with "your profit is
overstated", never with "we found you € 340"). It takes a `RangeResult`, which
`computeResultForRange` already produces, so wiring it anywhere is a few lines once the destination
is chosen. Two other modules are also uncalled — `deck.ts` (buildDeck) and `recon-confirm-client.ts`
(confirmReconPayment) — and were not investigated further.

## 11. The signature hunt, closed out — 31 August 2026

§10 listed five survivors as open. They are settled, along with the rest of the pass: 35 findings,
105 skeptic verdicts, 22 survivors of a 2-of-3 majority. Every one is now fixed, written as a
migration, or recorded here with the measurement that says why not.

### Fixed in code

| Where | What it did |
| --- | --- |
| `cron/payment-due` | auto-collected AND dunned the same invoice — two spellings of one supplier question |
| `kas-payment-events-fetch` | a slow query moved every cash payment into the wrong BTW quarter |
| `bank/unlink`, `bank/confirm` | the quarter-close board warned about a link the owner made by hand |
| `verkoop`, `incoming/missing` | two reads that said "nothing here" before finishing |
| `kas-payment-events-fetch`, `readiness`, `debiteuren` | three id-list reads that die at the gateway |
| `btw-reservation`, `api/aangifte` | the reservation asked for €1 less than the return just filed |
| `turnover/day`, `turnover/import`, `turnover-book` | a day's takings could be typed over, imported over, or deleted out from under itself |
| `closing-package` | the accountant's ZIP dated a cash payment from a different quarter than its own aangifte |
| `bank-auto-confirm`, `bank/unlink` | "one tap undoes it" lasted about an hour |
| `xaf-export` | the auditfile told the Belastingdienst a purchase was free |

### Written as migrations, NOT applied

Three, each idempotent and each stating in its own header that the assistant did not run it:

- `bank_auto_book_blocked.sql` — the column that makes an undone bank booking stay undone. The code
  is deploy-safe on both sides: without the migration the app behaves exactly as today.
- `accountant_vat_deduction_guard.sql` — `vat_deduction` was in no version of the accountant deny
  list, and it moves the client's rubriek 5b by the invoice's whole btw_amount. Adding it to the
  gate's list immediately failed six redefinitions; all six carry it now, which is the
  order-independence that gate exists to create.
- `creditnota_per_rate_ceiling.sql` — the only one I could not measure against a database, and its
  header says so and asks to be run when a normal creditnota can be made to confirm one still
  succeeds.

### Measured, and deliberately not changed

- **The kasstelsel quarter attribution** (`bulk-undo-pay`, `invoice-scan`). Both real: an invoice
  settled across two quarters warns about one, and the booked-invoice scan buckets a correction by
  invoice date where kas books it by payment date. Neither is reachable — **zero kasstelsel owners**
  in production, one invoice with multiple instalments, none spanning two quarters — and both need
  per-instalment dates plumbed through a screen another session was editing the same night.
- **An unmatched categorised bank line double-counts against its invoice.** Verified, and the
  finding's framing is incomplete: the unlink does not create the double count, it returns to the
  ordinary unmatched state which predates any link. Removing it means either deleting the invoice
  attach-invoice created — nothing marks which those are — or discarding the owner's own
  classification.

### Two findings were already fixed while the pass ran

The `/api/aangifte` phantom suppletie and the ignored-bank-line P&L leak were both closed by another
session the same night. Worth recording because the useful discipline is the same one that produced
everything above: **check the current code and the live database before acting on a finding, however
confident it sounds.** Two of twenty-two were already done, one migration's deny list turned out to
be six files wide, and one of my own SQL statements had a bug I only found by re-reading it.

---

## 12. The guard that only one of three writers had — 31 August 2026

An earlier pass found that a bill the owner marked paid by hand puts its cost in the books before
its bank debit ever arrives; the matcher excludes paid invoices, so the debit finds no candidate,
and a confident memory hit codes it `kosten` — the same cost twice, in the resultaat and in the
closing package. The fix landed in `bank-auto-categorize.ts` and was documented there at length.

It was documented in the one place it was not most needed. Three code paths write a category the
owner did not answer for personally, all running the same classifier over the same rows:

| Writer | Reached by | Had the guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `applyLearnedBankCategories` | import, cron, `/bank` load | yes |
| `bulkApply` | **the "N zekere invullen" button** | no |
| the `[ZELFDE-TEGENPARTIJ]` spread | confirming one line of a party | no |

The unguarded pair includes the one the owner presses.

### Measured before changing anything

Across production, 53 uncategorised bank lines — together **€ 31.188,87** — sit against a paid
invoice that already explains them (same direction, same amount to the cent, settled within a
fortnight). Of those, **45 (€ 22.821,96)** would be confidently coded `kosten` by one press of the
button, at one owner. Nothing downstream would have flagged it: readiness counts *excluded*
categories, and a doubled `kosten` is not excluded, it is deductible.

### What changed

The decision moved to `src/lib/bank-double-booking.ts` and the three writers ask it. Not copied —
copying it is what produced the defect. Two details were only visible once it was shared:

- **The spread and the sweep never read the line's date.** Without it every magnitude match reads
  as undatable, which the rule resolves toward holding — safe, but it would have frozen the sweep
  the owner presses. Both reads now select `date`, and the gate says why.
- **`mollie_payment_links` has RLS on with zero policies**, by design: every other access in the
  app goes through the service role. A guard wired with the caller's RLS client would have read an
  empty set, and "no rows" is indistinguishable from "this owner has no Mollie" — the payout hold
  would have been silently off on exactly the path that needed it. The route hands the probe a
  service-role client scoped to that `user_id`, and a probe that could not run reports
  `molliePayoutKnown: false` instead of an answer.

### The gate names no writers

A list of writers is what went missing the first time: the second and third were written later, by
someone reading the first. `[DUBBEL-GEDEKT]` in `lifecycle-gates.test.ts` derives the set from the
source instead — every update that stamps `category_confirmed: false` onto `bank_transactions` is,
by the app's own convention, a machine's inference rather than the owner's answer, which writes
`true` — and requires each one to consult the guard inside the loop that reaches it.

Verified by negative control, including the one that matters: a fourth writer added in a brand-new
file the gate had never heard of fails it on the day it is written.

### The half that only appeared once the first half worked

Blocking the machines opened a quieter door. A held line lands on the categorisatie screen looking
exactly like a line nobody could classify — same card, a `kosten` chip already selected, a confirm
button under it. One tap books the cost a second time, with the app's own suggestion saying it was
right, and the owner has no way of knowing.

So the screen was given what the server knows: the hold arrives as `already_booked`, the line is
excluded from the "N zekere invullen" hint (the sweep will not write it; promising it there is a
number that cannot be delivered), and it reaches the owner with **nothing chosen**, under a sentence
naming what already carries the amount. They may still pick `kosten` — two identical costs a
fortnight apart are possible — but they have to mean it.

The friction this adds is measurably nil: of the 53 held lines, 45 were the ones the button would
have coded and the other 8 were never going to be auto-coded at all. Nothing that used to be filled
in silently and correctly stopped being filled in.

The copy lives in `bank-already-booked-notice.ts` rather than in the component, and the reason→copy
map is a `Record` over the hold union rather than a switch with a default: a third hold reason stops
compiling until it has words, where a default branch would have shipped it wearing the wrong ones.

---

## 13. The checker said the guards were applied. They were not. — 31 August 2026

`docs/WELKE_MIGRATIES_STAAN_ER.sql` answers the one operational question that matters between a
written migration and a protected database: **what still needs applying?** It reported a clean
sheet — 114 migrations, 2 open. Both of those were already known.

It was wrong, and wrong in the direction that costs the most.

`prevent_accountant_amount_changes` is written by **nine** migration files. The probe asked whether
the FUNCTION exists — and it has, since the first of those nine. So all nine reported TOEGEPAST,
while the function running in production was missing three protected columns:

| Column | What an accountant could move without it |
| --- | --- |
| `vat_deduction` | rubriek 5b of the client's aangifte, by the invoice's whole `btw_amount` — on € 10.000 + 21% that is € 2.100, silently, in the return that goes to the Belastingdienst |
| `discount_type` | the invoice-level discount the e-factuur's amounts are derived from |
| `discount_value` | the same |

Both guards were written weeks ago, both were reported to the owner as "written, not applied", and
the one tool that answers "did I apply it?" said yes. That is not a migration that was forgotten —
it is a measurement that could not see what it claimed to check.

This is the same defect the file's own header is about, one level down. That header records the
question drifting behind the folder ("de VRAAG staat hier met de hand in"), which was fixed by
generating it. Nobody asked whether the ANSWER could drift: **existence stops being evidence the
moment a second file writes the same object.** Eight functions in this repo are written by more
than one migration, covering about twenty files.

### What the probe measures now

For a function with more than one definer, the generated query reads the deployed body and checks
every `NEW.`/`OLD.` column reference that **every** current definition contains — what the folder
unanimously says belongs in that function, whichever file you happen to open. Run against
production it returns exactly `.discount_type, .discount_value, .vat_deduction`.

The intersection and not the union, deliberately: a union would carry a column one definition
deliberately dropped, and then an alarm goes off that can never be cleared — which teaches everyone
to click it away, the failure this file's own header warns about twice.

Where several definitions share no column reference at all (a non-trigger function), the list says
so in words rather than falling silent: *"GEEN INHOUDSMETING — Deel 1 valt hier terug op het bestaan
van de functie, en dat bewijst alleen dat de EERSTE van deze migraties gedraaid heeft."*

The gate derives its rule from the generated list rather than from a list of functions someone
maintains: **no function name may be probed by mere existence from more than one file**, unless the
list itself explains why it cannot be measured. A tenth redefinition of anything fails it on the
day it is written.

### Also closed

`src/lib/recon-confirm-client.ts` was deleted. The audit recorded it as "a complete feature nothing
calls"; it is not a feature, it is a second spelling of `useInvoiceReconciliation.confirmMatch`,
which two screens do call — and the worse of the two: it reports a 409 `invoice_already_paid` as
`'error'`, so an invoice the auto-confirm had already booked would have shown the owner "mislukt".
`deck.ts` is not uncalled either: `scripts/generate-deck.mts` builds from it.

### Applied to production, 31 August 2026 — with the owner's approval

`accountant_discount_guard.sql` (which carries the full 24-column deny list, including
`vat_deduction`) was applied. Checked before applying, because a `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`
silently resets what it does not restate: the live function was `SECURITY INVOKER`, no
`search_path`, `VOLATILE` — exactly what the file produces, so nothing was lost. Verified after:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| the file's own CONTROLE block (4 assertions) | all true |
| `vendor_iban` / `payment_reference` / `document_id` still protected | yes |
| both mandate exceptions (opstellen, bevestigen) still reachable | yes |
| trigger still attached to `invoices` | yes, 1 |
| `security definer` / `search_path` / volatility | unchanged |
| the new body probe, the one that reported the hole an hour earlier | TOEGEPAST, nothing missing |

And then the guard was made to **bite**, in a transaction that always aborts: acting as a uid that
is neither sender nor receiver and holds no mandate, `vat_deduction`, `discount_value` and
`vendor_iban` were each GEWEIGERD; acting as the invoice's own receiver, `vat_deduction` was
TOEGESTAAN — so `/dashboard/incoming/manage`, the one screen that writes that column, still works.
The proof left nothing behind; the row it ran against is byte-for-byte as it was.

A deployed text is not a working rule. The difference is one query, and it is the query nobody runs.

### One truncation found while verifying the fix itself

The generator caps a migration at six probes, chosen alphabetically. `vat_exemption.sql` has six
ordinary column and constraint probes, so `function_body` — which sorts after both — fell off the
end. A cap that cuts exactly the sharpest measurement is a silent truncation of the same kind as
the defect it was written for, so a body probe now survives the cap unconditionally and the gate
walks the folder: every file that rewrites the guard must carry one.

(The finding before it was mine, not the tool's: I read the emitted marker list with a `grep` that
dropped its first field and briefly believed `amount_paid` had gone missing. It had not — all 24
columns were there. Worth recording, because it is the third time this week that the thing which
looked broken was the measurement rather than the thing measured.)

### Still open, and now accurately reported

- `bank_auto_book_blocked.sql` and `creditnota_per_rate_ceiling.sql` — the two the checker always
  named correctly (they create objects that do not exist yet).
- `accountant_vat_deduction_guard.sql` reads TOEGEPAST now and that is correct: its columns are in
  the deployed body. The two files are two spellings of one deny list, which is the convention this
  family documents — whichever runs last, the list is whole.
- The 14 invoices with `amount_paid = 0` whose links cover the total (7 incoming € 1.071,89,
  7 outgoing € 4.249,79): approved for repair via `recompute_invoice_amount_paid`, not yet run.

---

## 14. The 14 invoices, repaired — 2 September 2026

Approved by the owner, run against production, verified both ways.

Fourteen invoices sat `status = 'paid'` with bank links covering their total exactly and
`amount_paid = 0`. Six belong to a real owner, eight to the demo dossier. The aangifte was never
affected — `isSettled` reads `amount_paid > 0 || status === 'paid'` precisely for rows like these —
but every screen and check that reads `amount_paid` saw zero, and the money audit described them
with a sentence about the wrong thing.

### What was checked before writing

- **The deployed function, not the file.** `recompute_invoice_amount_paid` is written by TWO
  migrations. The one live in production is `invoice_partial_payments.sql`'s: it writes
  `amount_paid` and nothing else. `invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql`, which also re-derives
  `payment_date`, **has not been applied** — which the new body probe from §13 reports correctly,
  and which mattered here: a repair that moved fourteen payment dates is a different act entirely.
- **Every trigger on `invoices`.** Six, all BEFORE. The two `verwerkt` guards do not fire
  (`accountant_status` is null on all fourteen), the creditnota ceiling does not fire (all fourteen
  are `factuur`), and the accountant guard's first exception passes for a service-role caller.
- **The scheme.** Both owners are `vat_scheme = 'factuur'`, so BTW follows the invoice date and
  `amount_paid` cannot move a quarter even in principle.

### How it was run

One statement, therefore one transaction — all fourteen or none. The defect was **re-asserted per
row inside that statement** (`amount_paid = 0` AND links covering the total), so a row that had
stopped matching between the measurement and the write would have excluded itself instead of being
written blindly.

### Verified after

The same aggregate query, before and after, over both owners by direction and quarter:

| Column | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `som_inc`, `som_btw` (the aangifte's inputs) | **byte-identical in all 8 groups** |
| `openstaand` | byte-identical |
| row counts | byte-identical |
| `amount_paid` over the invoice total | 0 before, 0 after |
| `som_betaald` | +297,12 · +401,99 · +774,77 · +3.847,80 = **€ 5.321,68**, exactly the measured set |

And app-wide afterwards: **0** invoices still matching the defect, **0** whose `amount_paid`
disagrees with its links by more than a cent, **0** claiming more paid than their total.

No tax figure moved. That is the claim the before/after pair exists to support, and it is the only
reason a repair to real books was worth running at all.

---

## 15. The blind spot in the checker I had just built — 2 September 2026

§13 replaced an existence probe with a body probe, because nine migrations write one function and
existence could not tell them apart. It measured the `NEW.`/`OLD.` column references every current
definition shares — which works for a **trigger** function and for nothing else.

Five of the eight multi-definer functions are not triggers. They fell back to existence, and the
report said TOEGEPAST about **two migrations that had not run**:

| Migration | What is missing from production | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invoice_move_payment_creditnota_guard.sql` | `move_invoice_payment` does not read `invoice_type` | **A money guard.** Its own header records the reproduction: a € 100 payment moved onto a creditnota (total −100, status 'sent') came back `amount_paid = 100`, `status = 'paid'` — while the sales invoice the payment really belonged to silently lost it |
| `invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql` | `recompute_invoice_amount_paid` does not re-derive `payment_date` | Under kasstelsel, a payment's date decides its quarter |

The second was found by accident, checking which version of that function was deployed before
running the 14-invoice repair — and it was luck that it was checked at all. The first was found
only because that accident prompted this sweep.

### Why the intersection could not see them

Deliberately: the intersection is what every definition agrees on, and what a newer version **adds**
is by definition not in it. That property is what stops a permanent false alarm; it is also exactly
what hides an unapplied upgrade.

So for a function with no shared column reference, the newest version is now **derived** rather than
assumed absent. This folder has no ordering, but this family has a convention — each redefinition
carries the previous one and adds — so the newest is the version whose tokens are a strict superset
of every other's. Where such a version exists it is measured on what only it adds; where none does
(`book_bank_batch`, whose two files are kept byte-identical on purpose) the list says so in words.
The older files keep their existence probe: superseded is not the same as unrun, and OPEN would be
the wrong word for them.

A marker has to refer to something. `false`, `order` and `limit` are unique to a version and say
nothing, so a marker must contain an underscore or be eight characters — a rule about shape, not a
list of forbidden words, because a list of forbidden words goes stale like every other list.

### What is actually still open, as of this sweep

- `bank_auto_book_blocked.sql` — the column and index do not exist. Known and correctly reported all
  along; the code is deploy-safe without it.
- `invoice_move_payment_creditnota_guard.sql` — **new**, and the one with money behind it.
- `invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql` — **new**.

> **All three are applied as of 2 September 2026** — the owner ran them. Verified against production
> rather than assumed: both functions' `prosrc` md5 matches the repo file byte for byte
> (`527f1d0d…` and `5490918f…`), and `bank_transactions.auto_book_blocked_at` exists with its
> comment and its partial index `bank_transactions_auto_book_open_idx`. That last one also closes

And one that closed itself: `creditnota_per_rate_ceiling.sql` is now applied — `assert_credit_within_rate`
exists. It was open at the previous sweep, so somebody ran it in between.

### The pattern, for the third time in three days

A rule that is real, and a list beside it that nobody maintains: the migration inventory's question,
then its answer, then the icon subset. Each was found only by measuring the thing itself instead of
reading what was written about it. The generator, the icon list and the guard columns are all
derived from source now — and this entry exists because the second of those was written by me,
two days ago, with a blind spot I did not look for until an unrelated check tripped over it.

### Both applied, 2 September 2026 — with the owner's approval

`invoice_move_payment_creditnota_guard.sql` and `invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql` are on
production. Checked before, measured before, verified after.

**Before.** Both are one `CREATE OR REPLACE` in a transaction plus a `COMMENT` and a
`REVOKE`/`GRANT`. Signatures match the deployed ones exactly — `(uuid,uuid,uuid)` and `(uuid,uuid)`
— so they replace rather than create an overload. Both declare `SECURITY DEFINER` and
`search_path = public`, which is what the live functions already carried, so nothing was reset by
restating it.

**One thing beyond the fix, named rather than slipped through.** `invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql`
grants `EXECUTE` to `authenticated`; the deployed function had only `postgres` and `service_role`,
and every live caller uses the service role. The widening is defensible — the function refuses when
`auth.uid()` is not the owner, and it can only re-derive from links that already exist — but it is a
change, so it was put to the owner as a choice rather than applied quietly. Approved as written: the
file is the record, and editing it to differ from what a human would run in the SQL editor creates
two spellings of one migration.

**Measured before turning the date logic on.** Of 404 invoices carrying links, exactly **1** would
get a different `payment_date` if the function ran over all of them, and **0** would move to a
different quarter. There are **0** kasstelsel owners of 9, so the quarter question does not bite
anyone today in any case. The function only runs on reversal paths, so nothing changed
retroactively; what changed is what future reversals do.

**The creditnota exposure was latent, not fired.** 12 creditnota's are in a status that makes them a
valid move target and 405 payments are movable, so the door stood open — but the one creditnota
carrying `amount_paid > 0` turned out to be a genuine € 1.123,14 Metro Markets refund, matched to a
real credit on the statement. Nothing in the books had gone wrong yet.

**After.**

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| deployed `move_invoice_payment` body vs the file | md5 `527f1d0d…707`, 11.464 chars — **byte-identical** |
| deployed `recompute_invoice_amount_paid` body vs the file | md5 `5490918f…f44`, 2.125 chars — **byte-identical** |
| signatures, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path` | unchanged |
| `EXECUTE` grants | as the files declare |
| the body probe that reported both OPEN an hour earlier | both TOEGEPAST |

And the guard was made to **bite**, in a transaction that always aborts: moving a real payment onto
a payable creditnota was **refused, and refused for the creditnota reason**; the same payment moved
onto an ordinary invoice was **allowed**. So it stops the thing it was written for without
over-refusing the ordinary case. Nothing persisted — 405 links before and after, the Metro Markets
creditnota untouched, no invoice paid above its total.

The hash comparison is the part worth keeping as a habit: a 12 KB money function had to be pasted by
hand into the migration tool, and "it looks right" is not a check. Computing the file's body hash
first turns a transcription slip from something you hope you would notice into something that cannot
pass.

### Still open after this

Only `bank_auto_book_blocked.sql` — the column and index do not exist. The code is deploy-safe
without it, and it needs a design choice about what the readiness board shows, so it is not a
paste-and-run.

## 16. §6 item 1 has an instrument now — but not yet a measurement — 2 September 2026

`§6` has listed the same thing at number one since this file was written: _"a live `upload → DB →
/api/result` pass. The proof `RECONCILIATION_TRIANGLE.md` names as final and that no amount of unit
testing substitutes for. Needs a running Supabase."_ It stayed at number one through every
re-measurement since, because each pass could only confirm it was still open.

It is worth being precise about why no test in this repo covers it. `npm run gates` never calls
Supabase once: `tsc`, the unit tests, the render tests and `next build` are all static, and the
Playwright sweep only walks the public pages, which is where the middleware lets it in without a
session. So there has never been a check that says whether the figures an owner reads on their
screen belong to the rows sitting under them in the database.

`scripts/verify-live-chain.mts` is that check. It logs in as an owner, reads the raw rows back
through RLS, calls `/api/result`, `/api/aangifte` and `/api/truth` with the session, and compares what
they say using **plain arithmetic** — adding, subtracting, comparing — never by calling an engine:

- `invoices.amount_paid` equals the sum of `bank_tx_invoices.amount_applied` for that invoice;
- `resultaat` = `omzet` − `kosten`, and `btwSaldo` = `verschuldigd` − `voorbelasting`;
- the rate buckets add up to `btwVerschuldigd`;
- every figure is a finite number (an `NaN` travels silently through every later sum);
- the BTW is at most 30% of the turnover — the incl./excl. swap, which is invisible otherwise
  because both numbers look plausible on their own;
- `5g` = `5a` − `5b` on the concept aangifte, and the rubrieken add up to `5a`;
- the aangifte and the result do not name two different amounts for the same quarter;
- and `/api/truth` — the screen an owner opens beside the result — names the same six figures
  for the same quarter. `/api/result` promises that in its own header ("the same function over
  a different window"); the promise lives in a comment and was checked nowhere.

**What it does not prove:** that the calculation rules are right. The unit tests do that, and they
are good. This aims at the layer between the database and the API answer — the assembly — because
that is where every defect of the past week actually was: a key that was correct but stored in the
row that undoing removes; a definition spelled twice; a read that returned "nothing found" because
it had been truncated.

**Read-only, on purpose.** It runs against a real database. A script that creates rows to delete
them afterwards leaves something behind on every interrupted run, and the first time somebody aims
it at a live administratie by accident it stops being a test and becomes a booking. Existing rows
answer the same question.

### Three defects in the instrument, before it measured anything

Each one would have made the tool lie, and in the same direction — toward a false alarm about money.

1. **The session cookie was invented rather than written.** The first version sent
   `Authorization: Bearer …` and a hand-rolled `cookie: sb-access-token=…`. The routes read their
   session with `@supabase/ssr` (`supabase-server.ts`), which uses a project-scoped cookie name and
   a `base64-` encoding it chunks itself — so that header authenticates nobody. Every check below it
   would have gone red with a 401, over something with no money in it at all. It now lets the same
   library write the cookie into an in-memory jar, so the encoding cannot drift from what the route
   reads back. Proven offline, without a network: the cookie the script sends is parsed by a second
   `createServerClient`, which recovers the same user id.

2. **A 401 counted as a failed check.** That is the worse half of (1) and survives independently of
   it: a verifier that cannot distinguish _"I could not look"_ from _"your books are wrong"_ is
   worse than no verifier, because it sends somebody hunting through an administratie for a fault
   that is a missing cookie. `401`/`403` now stop the run with an explicit "nothing was checked,
   this says nothing about the bookkeeping", and exit 2 — never a red line.

3. **The two raw reads were unpaged.** PostgREST truncates at ~1000 rows in silence
   (`supabase-paginate.ts`), so on a busy administratie the tool would have read the first thousand
   payment links and reported properly-paid invoices as half paid. That is one of the three defect
   classes the script's own preamble names as this week's causes — written straight into the
   instrument built to find them. Both reads now go through `fetchAllRows`.

### What is still open

Item 1 is **not** closed. What exists is the instrument; the measurement has not been taken. This
container cannot reach `cedrndplmydqcmbszfmp.supabase.co` — the organisation's egress policy denies
it — so the script has never run against live data. It passes `tsc`, `eslint` and the full gate set,
and its cookie encoding is proven by an offline round-trip, and that is all that can honestly be
claimed for it here.

To take the measurement, on a machine that can reach the database:

```bash
npx next build && npx next start -p 3100
CHAIN_EMAIL=demo@boekbrug.nl CHAIN_PASSWORD=… npx tsx scripts/verify-live-chain.mts
```

Exit 0 means the live app and the rows underneath it agree. Exit 1 names what disagreed, and where
to look: not in the engines, which have their own tests, but in which rows are read and how they are
put together. Exit 2 means the check could not run — which is not a statement about money.

## 17. Three questions anyone on the internet could ask — 2 September 2026

Applying DDL is the moment to run the database linter, and it had not been run in this pass. It
found a class nobody had looked at: **a function created without an explicit `REVOKE` is granted to
`PUBLIC`, and `PUBLIC` includes `anon`** — the role behind every unauthenticated request to
`/rest/v1/rpc/*`.

Three `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers were callable by anyone, and all three take the identity they
answer about as a **parameter** instead of reading `auth.uid()`:

| Function | What a stranger could ask |
| --- | --- |
| `has_active_invoice_mandate(accountant, client)` | does this accountant hold an invoicing mandate over this client? |
| `has_active_confirm_mandate(accountant, client)` | …and a confirmation mandate? |
| `audit_row_is_about_me(type, entity_id, viewer)` | **is this invoice owned by this person?** |

`SECURITY DEFINER` means they answer with the owner's rights, so RLS never sees the question. The
third is the sharpest: an invoice id plus a user id returns a yes/no about who owns which document,
and an invoice id is not a secret — it travels in a payment link.

UUIDs are not guessable, so this was not a mass leak. It was also not an access control: "hard to
guess" is a property of the input, not a rule about who may ask.

### What made it safe to close — and what would have broken it

All three are used **only** inside policies whose role list is `{authenticated}`
(`audit_logs_about_me`, `invoices_mandate_confirm_read/write`, `invoices_mandate_draft_issue/read`,
`invoice_lines_mandate_read`). A policy expression runs with the privileges of the role evaluating
it, so removing anon's `EXECUTE` cannot break a policy anon never evaluates. No code in `src/` calls
any of them over RPC — zero call sites, checked.

**`is_my_accountant_client` was left alone, deliberately, and that is the half worth remembering.**
It looks like the same shape and it is not: four `{public}` policies call it —
`invoices_accountant_read`, `invoices_accountant_update_v2`, `invoice_lines_select_accountant`,
`documents_accountant_read` — so an anonymous `SELECT` on `invoices` or `documents` **evaluates it**.
Revoking would have turned those reads into a permission error instead of an empty result. It is
also not an oracle: it reads `auth.uid()`, which is NULL for a stranger, so it always answers false.
`acting_for_owner()` is the same case, used by seven policies.

Proven before applying, in a transaction that always aborts: the revoke flips anon's access from
`true` to `false`, signed-in access stays `true`, `is_my_accountant_client` keeps its grant — and an
anonymous `SELECT count(*) FROM invoices`, the query that evaluates the `{public}` policy, returned
**0 rows and no error**. That last line is the whole reason to run the experiment rather than reason
about it.

Verified after applying: all three closed to anon, all three still open to `authenticated` and
`service_role`, and the client check still public.

Reversal is one line per function (`GRANT EXECUTE … TO anon`), so this narrows and nothing else.

### What the linter flagged that is NOT a defect

- **Seven money RPCs executable by `authenticated`** (`apply_bank_payment`, `book_bank_batch`,
  `move_invoice_payment`, `apply_manual_payment`, `allocate_bank_payment`,
  `recompute_invoice_amount_paid`, `next_invoice_seq`). By design — the app calls them from user
  sessions, and every one refuses when `auth.uid()` is not the owner it was handed. Recorded so the
  next reader does not "fix" it. `recompute_invoice_amount_paid` appears on that list because
  today's migration put it there.
- **Five tables with RLS on and no policies** (`ai_spend_daily`, `cron_runs`, `intake_claims`,
  `mollie_payment_links`, `system_events`). RLS on with no policy denies everything, which is
  exactly the intent: these are service-role only. `mollie_payment_links` is the one §12 already
  had to work around.
- `pg_trgm` in the `public` schema — hardening, not a hole.

### Still open, and still the owner's

**Leaked Password Protection is still disabled.** Confirmed by the linter today, not from memory.
One toggle in the Supabase dashboard; it checks new passwords against HaveIBeenPwned.
## 18. §6 item 4, the half that was left — 2 September 2026

§8 answered half of item 4 and said so plainly: the *decisions* `cash-settle.ts` and
`incasso-settle.ts` carry were extracted and asserted, _"the I/O halves still need a database."_
That sentence was true about the I/O and wrong about what was left beside it.

What stayed behind in `loadCashSettlementState` is not I/O. It is **assembly** — three reads merged
into the one shape `computeCashSettlementSync` is allowed to act on — welded to the awaits that
produced them, and therefore reachable by no test. The same shape §8 found in `bank-tx-links.ts`,
in the module this audit's own table calls the largest untested money surface.

It is `cash-settle-assemble.ts` now: four decisions, none of which touch a database, each of which
can be silently wrong about somebody's money while the arithmetic downstream stays perfect.

| Decision | What a wrong answer does |
| --- | --- |
| how much cash an invoice holds | the old `gross − amount_paid` returned €0 for a fully cash-paid invoice, and a €0 settlement is not "leave it alone" — the reconcile **deletes the drawer entry** |
| whether it holds any at all | `cash_paid: 0` and `cash_paid: undefined` are different answers. `settlementGross` treats any non-null value as the whole truth, so a 0 written where nothing is known removes a real movement |
| which day the money moved | per-instalment each handover keeps its own; without the column the aggregate is dated by the **last** cash day, not by the invoice's `payment_date` — which can be the day a *bank* instalment landed, and one quarter over that is a different aangifte |
| which way it moved | an unreadable direction books as a purchase, so a cash **sale** leaves the drawer out by twice the amount |

16 tests, each named for the cost rather than the field. Every one was verified by breaking the
decision and watching that test — the one named for it — fail: the `undefined` collapsed to `0`,
`Math.abs` removed, the last cash day taken as the last row read instead of the latest, the
aggregate re-dated onto the invoice, instalments handed over without the column to write them
against, the timestamp left untruncated, the direction guess made silently, and a link with no
invoice turned into one. Eight mutations, eight named failures.

**One gate stopped being a gate.** `cash-settle-reach.test.ts` pinned the direction guess by
grepping this file, with its reason attached: _"the value never reaches this far — loadCashSettlementState
is I/O to its last line."_ That premise expired the moment `readableDirection` became a pure export,
so the grep is a behavioural test now and the source gate is reduced to the half that genuinely
cannot be reached: that the I/O module still hands the assembly something to report with.

### incasso-settle: measured, not assumed

The decisions §8 named there were already extracted, and the settle loop's remaining inline
judgement is not about a euro — it is about whether anyone **hears** about one. `apply_manual_payment`
refuses by raising, and its eleven refusals split in two: four the RPC is right to make (already
paid, already covered, locked by an accountant, a status that moved) where the invoice simply stays
open and visible, and seven that are real — a caller booking for the wrong owner, an invoice with no
total, and an **idempotency key belonging to a different booking**, which is the double-booking guard
firing on the one pass that books payments nobody typed.

That split was a bare `msg.includes` chain, matched against strings that live in SQL in another
file. It is `isExpectedBookingRefusal` now, and its test reads the messages **out of the migrations**
rather than restating them: reword one and a test fails, instead of a normal hourly race quietly
becoming an error in the log — or a real failure quietly becoming silence.

**One thing measured and deliberately left alone.** `Array.isArray(applyRows) ? applyRows[0] : undefined`
looked like a place a booked payment could fall out of the report. It is not: the function is
`RETURNS TABLE(...)`, so PostgREST always yields an array, and every refusal path raises rather than
returning zero rows. Handling an object there would be inventing a case that cannot occur.

### The sixth caller that threw the answer away

`bank_auto_book_blocked.sql` is the one migration still open, and both sides of it were written
deploy-safe: `bank-auto-confirm.ts` probes for the column before filtering on it, and
`/api/bank/unlink` writes the blockade best-effort so a lagging migration can never break an
unlink. The write was `await (… as PromiseLike<unknown>)`, which discards the answer — and that
discards **two** answers at once:

* the column is not there yet — expected, harmless, and the entire reason the write stands apart;
* the write **failed** while the column is there — the blockade is not recorded, the next cron
  round makes the same booking again, and under kasstelsel that invoice's BTW lands in the wrong
  quarter. After the owner tapped Ontkoppelen and read that it was undone.

That is exactly the discrimination `column-probe.ts` was built for, and this is the sixth caller
straightened out the same way: an absent column stays silent, anything else reaches
`reportHandledFailure`. Gated as a rule — the error is bound, `columnIsAbsent` is imported rather
than re-spelled, and a non-absent error reaches the reporter — and verified by breaking each of
those three in turn.

### The mutation run found a defect in my own test

The fourth control — reword a refusal in the SQL and watch the test catch it — came back **NOT
CAUGHT**. Two migrations define `apply_manual_payment` (the original and the idempotency-scope
rewrite) and both carry the full set of messages; the test unioned them, so the superseded file's
old spelling covered for the live one. The messages are read per defining file now and required in
all of them, because two spellings of one refusal drifting apart is the same defect from the other
side. It is the third time in this document that a check written to measure something turned out to
be measuring the wrong copy of it — and the only reason this one was found is that the mutation was
run instead of assumed.

## 19. Five screens said "gekopieerd" over a clipboard that had refused — 2 September 2026

The owner's original report was small: dragging across an invoice number to copy it made the card
open and shut under the cursor. `row-tap.ts` answered that, and a copy button answered the goal
behind it. Building the button meant asking who else copies, and the answer was worse than the
report.

**Seven places wrote to the clipboard. Five of them told the owner it had worked regardless.**

```ts
try { await navigator.clipboard.writeText(value) } catch { /* clipboard may be blocked */ }
setCopied(label)                                    // ← runs either way
```

and in the two payment sheets, the same thing said out loud:

```ts
} catch {
  onCopied(label) // best-effort; clipboard may be blocked in some contexts
}
```

### Why this is a money defect and not a cosmetic one

A refused clipboard write does not empty the clipboard. It leaves the **previous** value on it.

The values these screens copy are the IBAN, the amount and the payment reference — the three fields
of a bank transfer. So: copy supplier A's IBAN from their payment sheet. Open supplier B's sheet and
tap copy; the write is refused. The screen says *"IBAN gekopieerd ✓"*. The clipboard still holds A's
IBAN. The owner pastes it into their banking app and pays the wrong supplier, with every screen they
looked at agreeing that the right thing was on the clipboard.

Refusal is not exotic. `writeText` rejects on an unfocused document, outside a secure context, on a
denied permission, and in several in-app WebViews — and this app ships to Android as a Trusted Web
Activity, which is the WebView case. The failure mode was aimed at the delivery channel the product
actually uses.

The two link-copying screens are the same shape with a different payload: a **payment link**. A
stale clipboard there sends customer B the link to customer A's invoice.

### What changed

One module writes the clipboard now — `src/lib/clipboard.ts` — and it returns whether the write
happened. `true` comes only from the resolved path; a rejection, a missing API and an empty value
are all `false`. Every screen branches on the answer and has words for both outcomes.

The failure sentence names the hazard rather than the inconvenience: *"Kopiëren lukte niet — op je
klembord staat nog het vorige."* "It didn't work" would let an owner paste anyway. It carries no
parameter, deliberately — naming the field would put a noun inside a sentence, which AGENTS.md
forbids for exactly the languages this app now ships in, and the field name adds nothing next to the
fact that the clipboard is stale.

The honesty is proven **once**, in `clipboard.test.ts`, instead of six times in six components —
which is precisely what nobody did.

### The eighth site, and why the gate scans for the API instead of the call

The first sweep grepped `clipboard.writeText` and found seven. An eighth was
`navigator.clipboard?.writeText(...)` in the accountant module — optional chaining, which that
pattern walks straight past. It was also a floating promise: nothing awaited, no feedback at all,
success or failure.

Then the gate's own first version made the mirror-image mistake. It matched the
`navigator.clipboard.writeText` chain and found **zero** writers — including `clipboard.ts`, which
binds the API to a local before writing. Written as a count that would have been a green gate over
an empty set. It was written as a set comparison against the one file expected to appear, so it
failed loudly instead.

The rule is now: **exactly one file in `src/` may name `navigator.clipboard`**, found by scanning
the tree; every caller must keep the answer (`await copyToClipboard(…)` standing alone as a
statement is the original bug with a new import); and the catalogue must carry the words for a
failure. Comments are stripped before matching, so a file that only *describes* the old shape — this
document's own examples, and the comment left at the site that carried it — is not a writer.

### Verified by breaking it

Six mutations, six distinct failures: a second writer reintroduced; the helper returning `true` from
its catch; a caller discarding the result; an empty value reported as copied; the refused state
printing "Gekopieerd" again; and one row's copy state colouring the other three. The last two are
caught by a new render test over the **public** payment page, `/pay/[token]` — the screen the
owner's customers open to pay, which had no render coverage at all because its data arrives in an
effect the server never runs and the smoke test cannot reach a token-bearing URL.

### The gate that caught the fix

`[NUMMER-KOPIEREN]`, written an hour earlier for the copy button, went red on this change. It had
pinned the button's own `await navigator.clipboard.writeText` as the proof that no success is
claimed before the write resolves — and that line had just moved into the shared module. The gate
was right to fail: the guarantee it names had relocated, and nothing in the button proved it any
more. It now pins the guarantee where it lives, that the toast branches on the answer
`copyToClipboard` gives back.

Worth recording how it was nearly missed. While iterating, the gates were run filtered
(`--test-name-pattern="KOPIE-EERLIJK"`), which is fast and reports a clean `# pass 1 # fail 0` —
from a file where another test was failing the whole time. The filtered run is a debugging tool, not
evidence. Only the unfiltered file is.

### The pattern, again

Every miss in this section was a measurement that could not see where the defect lived: a grep blind
to optional chaining, then a gate blind to a local variable, then a test run filtered down to the
one test that was passing. That is the fourth, fifth and sixth time in this document. The habit that
caught all three is the same one: **run the mutation, and run it against everything, do not assume
the check works.**
