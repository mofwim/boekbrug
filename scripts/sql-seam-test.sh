# [SEAM] Run tests/sql/*.test.sql against a real PostgreSQL.
#
# ── WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE GATE ──
# The other five gates need no services, which is what makes them runnable on a clean checkout with
# an empty environment. This one needs a database, so it cannot join `npm run gates` without taking
# that property away from every contributor. It runs in CI instead, where a postgres service is one
# line of yaml — and it is the only gate that can see a plpgsql contract at all.
#
# Locally: start any PostgreSQL and set DATABASE_URL (or the usual PG* variables), then
#   npm run test:sql
# Without one it prints how to run it and exits 0. That is a deliberate local convenience and NOT
# how it behaves in CI: SQL_SEAM_REQUIRED=1 turns a missing database into a failure, and the CI
# workflow sets it — so the gate can never go quietly green because nothing ran.

# ── [SEAM-GUARD] The fixture's first statement is DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE ─────────────────────
#
# So this runner must never reach a database with real data, and the check that stood here was
# the database NAME alone, with 'postgres' on its allow-list. 'postgres' is the name of EVERY
# Supabase project's database. A DATABASE_URL copied from a project's settings page passed the
# check, and the next thing to run would have been the DROP — on production, with no confirmation
# and no undo. The instructions printed above even suggested a URL ending in /postgres.
#
# Three refusals now, independent of each other, so that any one of them is enough:
#   1. the NAME must say it is scratch ('postgres' is gone, and so is 'ci' — it matches too much);
#   2. the HOST must be local, and a Supabase host is refused outright;
#   3. the database must not carry a Supabase signature (auth.users). The fixture creates `auth`
#      with one stub function and nothing else, so that table can only mean a real project.
# None of them can be reasoned around by a URL that "looks fine"; they read the live connection.
