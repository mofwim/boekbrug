// scripts/gate-yield.ts
// [POORT-OPBRENGST] What does each gate actually catch?
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Run (env from .env.local):
//   npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/gate-yield.ts
//   npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/gate-yield.ts --days 365 --limit 5000
//
// Read-only. Writes nothing, changes nothing, sends nothing. Safe to run in
// production, and it is meant to be run there — that is where the answer lives.
//
// ── WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS ──
//
// Six things stand between a freshly-read purchase invoice and its own booking:
// the arithmetic, the model's confidence in itself, [GEGROND] (is the figure
// printed in the document's own characters), [DOCCHECK] (is it printed WHERE a
// total is printed), the printed BTW split, and the supplier's own e-invoice.
// Every one of them was added because a real invoice got through the ones before
// it. Every one of them also costs a human a look.
//
// Nobody in this project can currently answer: WHICH ONES STILL EARN THEIR KEEP?
// Two independent reviews of this codebase both put that question first and
// neither could answer it. That is the finding, not a step toward one — you
// cannot delete what you have not measured, and a gate nobody has measured is
// a gate nobody can defend.
//
// So this replays shouldAutoAdvanceInvoice over rows that already exist and
// reports, per gate, the number that matters:
//
//     HOW OFTEN WAS THIS GATE THE *ONLY* THING HOLDING THE INVOICE?
//
// Not how often it fired — that number flatters every gate, because gates
// overlap and a badly-read invoice trips four of them at once. The honest
// question is the marginal one: if this gate did not exist, how many invoices
// would have been booked without a human? A gate whose marginal yield is 0 over
// a year of real documents is not protecting anything. It is a tax on every
// import, paid in human attention, for a case that has not happened.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──
//
// It does not recommend deleting anything. A zero here is the START of that
// conversation, not the end of it: a gate can have zero yield because the risk
// is genuinely rare and catastrophic (the BTW-zero gate protects the
// voorbelasting, the one number this app exists to protect), or because the read
// is now good enough that it never triggers. Those two look identical in a
// count and could not be more different in consequence. The number tells you
// where to LOOK — exactly like reading-memory.ts does for the owner, and for the
// same reason.
