-- [BANK-BATCH-ATOMIC] Atomic multi-invoice batch booking — migration
-- BoekBrug · July 2026
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY: runBankAutoConfirm's batch pass booked a multi-invoice tie in
-- several separate statements (pay each invoice, THEN link the tx, THEN
-- record the join rows). Two overlapping runs over the SAME batch tx could
-- interleave so that one run paid invoice A + won the tx link while the
-- other paid invoice B, lost the link, and rolled B back — leaving the tx
-- 'matched' but B 'received' (unpaid) and never retried. A paid invoice
-- shown "te laat" forever = a payment-linkage LOSS.
--
-- FIX: do the whole tie in ONE database transaction (this function). It
-- takes a row lock on the bank line FIRST (the mutex), re-verifies every
-- invoice is still payable UNDER that lock, then pays + links + records —
-- all-or-nothing. A concurrent booker blocks on the lock and, after we
-- commit, sees the tx is no longer 'pending' and gets zero rows back (it
-- skips cleanly, never double-books). Any invoice that turned unpayable in
-- the window aborts the WHOLE batch (RAISE → rollback), so a batch is never
-- half-booked.
--
-- SAFETY: identical money discipline to the app path it replaces —
--   · only pays invoices that are currently UNPAID and not accountant-
--     'verwerkt' (B.4), owned by the caller,
--   · links exactly one representative invoice_id onto the tx (the same
--     shape the manual allCovered path writes),
--   · records EVERY paid invoice in bank_tx_invoices (collision-free undo
--     index), so unlink / delete-statement still reverses by id.
-- Fully reversible; the caller still writes the audit row.
--
-- APPLY: run this whole file in the Supabase SQL editor (one transaction).
-- Nothing here deletes data. Idempotent / re-runnable (CREATE OR REPLACE).
-- The CODE that calls book_bank_batch degrades safely if this is not yet
-- applied (the rpc errors → the batch simply isn't auto-booked that run),
-- so there is no hard ordering requirement, but apply this FIRST to enable
-- the feature.

-- [BANK-BATCH-AMBIGU] This function RETURNS TABLE(invoice_id uuid), which declares a plpgsql
-- variable of that name -- and step (3) below says ON CONFLICT (transaction_id, invoice_id).
-- plpgsql cannot tell whether that means the variable or the column, and its default
-- (variable_conflict = error) refuses to guess. So EVERY call raised
--
--     column reference "invoice_id" is ambiguous
--
-- on the simplest possible input: two invoices tying exactly to the line. The batch pass in
-- bank-auto-confirm.ts answers a raise with `if (batchErr) continue`, and its comment reads
-- "error => not payable / migration not applied => the batch stays for the human" -- so the
-- failure looked like an expected outcome, every time, forever. Multi-invoice auto-confirmation
-- has never booked anything.
--
-- One line settles it: inside the conflict target a bare name means the COLUMN. Nothing else in
-- this function shares a name with a column, so this directive touches exactly that identifier.

  -- [BANK-BATCH-GELIJK] This file and bank_confirm_atomic.sql BOTH define book_bank_batch, and

  --      open balances, under the lock. The caller planned against a snapshot;

  --      there. A broken tie aborts everything — nothing half-books.
  --
  --      [BANK-BATCH-ELDERS] Against what the line STILL HAS, not its face amount. This comparison
  --      ignored the euros already sitting on OTHER invoices of the same line, and a bank line
  --      stays 'pending' precisely while part of it is spent (confirm_bank_payment leaves it so).
  --      Measured: a EUR 1.000 debit with EUR 400 already booked elsewhere accepted a batch of
  --      EUR 1.000 and left Σ amount_applied at EUR 1.400 — the same euros booked twice, which is
  --      the exact state [BANK-OVERAPPLIED-LOUD] exists to shout about after the fact.
  --
  --      Signed, and by the LINE's direction: identical to the sum in confirm_bank_payment and to
  --      bank-line-budget.ts's spendsTheLine. A credit note gives money back to a debit and spends
  --      a refund, so summing magnitudes here would refuse a batch that fits.

  -- put money on one of these invoices, dropping the new row left amount_paid at the invoice's full
  -- magnitude (step 4) while Σ amount_applied still read the older, smaller figure — and
  -- amount_paid = Σ amount_applied is the one invariant this whole system rests on. The next unlink
