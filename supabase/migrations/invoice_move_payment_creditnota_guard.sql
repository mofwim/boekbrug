-- =====================================================================
-- [MOVE-CREDITNOTA] move_invoice_payment must refuse a creditnota TARGET.
-- BoekBrug · August 2026
-- =====================================================================
-- THE BUG. move_invoice_payment guarded the target's direction, status, remaining room and
-- ownership, but read its total through abs() and never looked at invoice_type. A creditnota is a
-- NEGATIVE document — money owed back to the customer — and is settled by paying out or offsetting,
-- never by receiving money. So a received bank payment could be moved onto a 'sent' creditnota,
-- which set its amount_paid to abs(total) and flipped it to 'paid', while the real sales invoice
-- the payment belonged to silently lost it.
--
-- Reproduced against a real Postgres: a EUR 100 payment moved onto a creditnota (total -100,
-- status 'sent') came back amount_paid=100, status='paid'.
--
-- THE FIX. Read invoice_type on the target and refuse 'creditnota'. Only the target: a creditnota
-- may still be the SOURCE, so a payment wrongly attached to one can be moved back off it. This is a
-- CREATE OR REPLACE of the whole function (the codebase's convention for an RPC fix — see
-- invoice_payment_date_rederive.sql); every other line is byte-identical to invoice_move_payment.sql.
