-- [NOOIT-BETAALBAAR] The three bank-payment doors refuse the states that are not a bill to pay.
-- BoekBrug · September 2026
--
-- WHAT WAS MEASURED
--
-- Three functions move bank money onto an invoice, and they differ in exactly one way: how much
-- of the bank line they spend. apply_bank_payment consumes the whole line, confirm_bank_payment
-- consumes whatever fits, allocate_bank_payment consumes a stated part. That difference is real
-- domain behaviour and is left untouched here.
--
-- What they SHARED was a two-item denial list: not already paid, not locked by the accountant.
-- The application has a wider rule -- isPayableInvoiceState in src/lib/bank-matching.ts, over
-- {paid, draft, archived, processing} plus verwerkt -- and book_bank_batch enforces that wider
-- rule in production at the database door, under the same row lock, for the same mutation. These
-- three did not. All three are SECURITY DEFINER and EXECUTE-granted to `authenticated`, so the
-- application layer is not a boundary: a crafted PostgREST call could pay a draft, an archived or
-- a still-unverified invoice that every screen in the product refuses.
--
-- Measured exposure when this was written: 69 invoices in those states (0 draft, 59 archived,
-- 10 processing), 1.332 pending bank lines, and 0 of those 69 carrying any money. Nothing to
-- repair -- this closes a door before it is used, it does not clean up after it.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO -- each considered and refused
--
--   · It does NOT introduce a shared payable/payability abstraction. The measurement did not
--     justify one: the deny half is shared, the allow half is not a concept these functions have.
--   · It does NOT change the three spending semantics, any signature, or any caller.
--   · It does NOT touch the existing `paid` and `verwerkt` refusals, which keep their own wording.
--   · It does NOT touch book_bank_batch. That function is declared twice in this repo and its
--     production definition is ahead of main; both are recorded as separate reconciliation items
--     and are deliberately out of scope here.
--
-- OWNERSHIP, AND WHY THE DEFINITIONS APPEAR TWICE
--
-- This migration owns the three definitions below. They are byte-identical to the ones in
-- invoice_partial_payments.sql, bank_confirm_atomic.sql and allocate_bank_payment.sql, which were
-- updated in the same change -- so a database built from those files in any order ends at the
-- same definition this file installs, and neither copy can quietly become the stale one. A gate
-- asserts the two copies agree. (That is the failure book_bank_batch already has, and the reason
-- it is worth the duplication here rather than leaving the originals lying.)
--
-- APPLY: run in the Supabase SQL editor. Deletes nothing. Idempotent.
