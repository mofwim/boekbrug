-- [INTAKE-CLAIM] The database backstop for the semantic-duplicate RACE.
--
-- Why this exists. The intake door's duplicate gate is read-then-insert: findSemanticDuplicate
-- SELECTs, and only then does the invoice INSERT run. The camera surface deliberately uploads
-- three files in parallel (MAX_PARALLEL_INTAKE), so the same paper photographed twice — different
-- bytes, so the byte-hash index cannot see it — can have BOTH requests pass the SELECT before
-- either has inserted. Both land, both can auto-advance, and the cost plus its voorbelasting is
-- booked twice. The byte-hash race has had a UNIQUE index behind it from day one
-- (uq_documents_user_content_hash); the SEMANTIC race had nothing, because the semantic key is
-- computed by TypeScript normalization that SQL cannot reproduce without becoming a second
-- authority on the key.
--
-- So the backstop stores the key WITHOUT recomputing it: a tiny claims table with a UNIQUE
-- (user_id, claim_key) index. The route computes the key (one authority, in code), INSERTs a
-- claim before it inserts the invoice, and a second in-flight upload of the same bill hits 23505
-- and is told the document is already being processed. Claims are short-lived working state, not
-- bookkeeping: a claim older than two minutes is stale (the request that made it is long dead)
-- and is taken over rather than honoured.
--
-- [DEPLOY-SAFE] Code ships before this is applied by hand. The route treats a missing table
-- (42P01) as "no backstop yet" and proceeds exactly as today — the feature switches on when this
-- runs, with no second deploy.
