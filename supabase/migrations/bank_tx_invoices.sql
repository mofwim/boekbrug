-- [BANK-TX-INVOICES] The payment ↔ invoice link as a first-class, COMPLETE relationship.
--
-- Why: a bank payment can settle SEVERAL invoices (a wholesaler batches a week of deliveries into
-- one debit). The old model stored only ONE representative invoice_id on the transaction, so the
-- other N−1 invoices a batch paid were invisible on the transaction. That under-representation made
-- reversal UNSAFE: to undo a batch you had to re-match by invoice NUMBER, and invoice numbers are
-- not unique (two suppliers both issue "1002"; a sales number can equal a purchase number), so a
-- number-based reversal could un-pay an unrelated invoice — a wrong-number event. It also made an
-- auto-booked payment unreachable to unlink after a page reload.
--
-- This join table records EVERY (transaction, invoice) that a booking paid. Every reversal
-- (unlink, batch-unlink, delete-statement cascade, auto-confirm rollback) then reverses by exact
-- invoice_id — never by number — so it can only ever touch the invoices this payment actually paid.
--
-- ON DELETE CASCADE on both FKs: deleting a transaction or an invoice removes its links
-- automatically (no dangling rows). One row per (transaction, invoice) — idempotent re-booking.
