-- [MOVE-PAYMENT] Move a booked payment from ONE invoice to ANOTHER.
-- BoekBrug - July 2026
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY: money lands on the wrong invoice. A supplier sends the same bill twice (the second one
-- corrected), the matcher picks the wrong one of two equal amounts, or the owner taps the payment
-- onto the row above. Until now the answer was: undo the payment on A, find the bank line again,
-- book it on B. Three actions - and between the first and the last the money exists nowhere: the
-- invoice that did receive it reads as open, the bank line is back under "Te bevestigen", and an
-- owner who stops there (the phone rings, the battery dies) leaves the books in that half state.
-- Exactly the kind of silent damage a bookkeeping app must not deal in.
--
-- Moving is one action and therefore has to be one TRANSACTION. Everything below happens inside
-- this function: the link row moves, both invoices have their amount_paid RE-DERIVED from the
-- surviving links, and both statuses follow. There is no moment where the money sits on zero
-- invoices, and none where it sits on two.
--
-- MODEL: a payment IS a row in bank_tx_invoices (amount_applied), with or without a bank line
-- behind it (a manual instalment has transaction_id NULL + paid_on + method). Moving = giving
-- that one row a different invoice_id. That keeps intact the single truth the rest of the system
-- already relies on:
--
--     invoices.amount_paid = SUM(bank_tx_invoices.amount_applied)
--
-- WHAT THIS FUNCTION REFUSES, and why it refuses instead of doing something clever:
--   - The target invoice does not have enough left open. Moving would either over-pay it, or
--     silently SPLIT the amount (move part, leave the rest). Both are an answer the owner never
--     gave, and the second one is not even visible. So: refuse, with both amounts in the message,
--     so the screen can say what IS still open.
--   - The same bank line is already linked to the target. Merging would turn two bookings into
--     one with no trace; that is not a move any more.
--   - Different direction. Money that went to a supplier can never settle a sales invoice.
--   - The accountant has processed one of the two. That lock wins, on either side.
--
-- APPLY: run this whole file in the Supabase SQL editor (one transaction).
-- Nothing here deletes data. Idempotent / re-runnable.
