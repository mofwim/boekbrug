-- migrations: seed_invoice_counter.sql
-- =====================================================================
-- [SEAM] seed_invoice_counter, against a real PostgreSQL.
-- Run: npm run test:sql   (see scripts/sql-seam-test.sh)
-- =====================================================================
-- factuur_b_numbering.sql is NOT loaded here. It does far more than define the counter — it seeds
-- from public.invoices, adds columns to profiles, and drops a function — none of which this
-- contract depends on. The fixture declares invoice_counters itself, and next_invoice_seq is
-- re-declared below in the two lines this test actually needs from it: the same atomic
-- INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE last_seq + 1. Loading the real migration for those two lines
-- would drag in half a schema and make a failure here say nothing about this function.
--
-- WHAT IS BEING HELD. The seeding path read last_seq, took Math.max against it in TypeScript, and
-- wrote the result with an unconditional upsert. An allocation inside that window made the counter
-- go BACKWARDS, and the next invoice reused a sequence — Article 35 Wet OB 1968 wants them
-- sequential, and the UNIQUE constraint only catches a duplicate while both invoices still exist.
-- =====================================================================

\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- The allocator, in the two lines this contract interacts with. Deliberately NOT a copy of the
-- whole function: the only thing that matters here is that it bumps the same row atomically.
