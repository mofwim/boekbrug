-- [SEAM] next_invoice_seq, against a real PostgreSQL — including two real sessions.
-- Run: npm run test:sql   (see scripts/sql-seam-test.sh)
-- =====================================================================
-- ── WHY THIS ONE ──
--
-- This is the function that mints a legal invoice number. Article 35 Wet OB 1968 wants a
-- sequential, gapless, forward-only series, and every guarantee behind that lives in ONE statement
-- inside this function. It had no seam test at all: seed_invoice_counter, its much smaller sibling,
-- has had one for months, while the allocator itself was only ever exercised against a hand-copied
-- stub in TypeScript — which cannot fail the way a database fails.
--
-- The claim that most needs a real database is the one a stub cannot make. Its own comment says it:
--
--     Concurrent callers serialize on the row lock taken by ON CONFLICT -- each gets a distinct
--     last_seq. No SELECT-then-compute window.
--
-- Every other test in tests/sql/ runs in a single psql session, so no file in this suite has ever
-- driven two callers at once — the gap behind every TOCTOU finding in this audit. dblink opens a
-- second REAL connection from inside the test, so the block below is two sessions contending for
-- one row, with a real lock and a real commit between them. Not a simulation of the race: the race.
--
-- dblink ships with postgresql-contrib and is present in the postgres:16 image CI uses. If it is
-- missing this file FAILS rather than skipping — a concurrency proof that quietly did not run is
-- worse than none, because the suite still reports green.
