-- migrations: invoice_manual_payments.sql, invoice_manual_payment_idempotency_scope.sql
-- =====================================================================
-- [SEAM] apply_manual_payment, against a real PostgreSQL.
-- Run: npm run test:sql   (see scripts/sql-seam-test.sh)
-- =====================================================================
-- ── WHY THIS ONE ──
--
-- This is the function behind every payment nobody observed on a bank statement: the "Al betaald?"
-- button on /vandaag, the pay dialog on the incoming-invoice screen, the cash handover in the
-- kasboek, and the auto-incasso pass in the reconcile cron. Four callers, one contract.
--
-- Its most-used behaviour is also its least visible: a NULL amount means "the whole rest". /vandaag
-- relies on that and names no amount at all — the panel there said "het hele bedrag" while what
-- landed was the remainder, which is how a partly-paid invoice came to be described wrongly on the
-- one screen the owner works from. The write was right; nothing in TypeScript could show that.
--
-- Everything below is asserted against a database that actually runs the function.
-- =====================================================================
