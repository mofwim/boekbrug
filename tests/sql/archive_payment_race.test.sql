-- migrations: invoice_manual_payments.sql, invoice_manual_payment_idempotency_scope.sql
-- =====================================================================
-- [SEAM] Archiving an invoice while a payment lands on it, against a real PostgreSQL.
-- Run: npm run test:sql   (see scripts/sql-seam-test.sh)
-- =====================================================================
-- ── WHY THIS ONE ──
--
-- /api/invoice/[id]/archive and /api/invoice/[id]/supersede both check for a booked payment with a
-- READ, and then write. Between those two statements the invoice is unprotected, and this is not a
-- quiet corner of the app: apply_manual_payment, apply_bank_payment, book_bank_batch and
-- allocate_bank_payment all reach the same row, and the owner's phone and the reconcile cron run
-- while this request is in flight.
--
-- Both routes answer that with a WHERE clause that re-asserts the status and the accountant lock.
-- The archive route's own comment says why it cannot do more: "it cannot re-assert a bank link".
--
-- The gap is the DEELBETALING. A payment that COMPLETES the invoice moves the status to 'paid',
-- which the WHERE already refuses. A partial one moves only amount_paid — the status stays exactly
-- where it was, every clause still matches, and the invoice is archived with a booked bank payment
-- hanging off it. The invoice then leaves every ledger while the bank line that paid it is skipped
-- as "payment of an already-counted invoice", so the debit counts NOWHERE and the quarter's kosten
-- and voorbelasting are quietly too low.
--
-- Below: the interleaving, with the real payment function booking the real instalment.
--
-- What this file does NOT prove: that the routes issue these statements. The [GELD-IN-WHERE] gates
-- in lifecycle-gates.test.ts hold that. Neither half is sufficient alone.
