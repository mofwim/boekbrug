-- migrations: book_bank_batch_atomic.sql, bank_confirm_atomic.sql
-- =====================================================================
-- [SEAM] book_bank_batch, against a real PostgreSQL.
-- Run: npm run test:sql   (see scripts/sql-seam-test.sh)
-- =====================================================================
-- BOTH migrations are loaded, in the order a deployment applies them, because BOTH define this
-- function and whichever runs last wins. That is not a detail: the second file added the tie
-- re-proof, so applying them the other way round used to remove it again, silently. The bodies are
-- now kept identical and this file proves it by running the pair.
--
-- ── WHAT THIS FOUND ──
--
-- book_bank_batch raised on EVERY call:
--
--     column reference "invoice_id" is ambiguous
--
-- RETURNS TABLE(invoice_id uuid) declares a plpgsql variable of that name, and step (3) says
-- ON CONFLICT (transaction_id, invoice_id). plpgsql refuses to guess which one is meant. The
-- simplest possible input reproduces it: two invoices tying exactly to the line.
--
-- The caller answers a raise with `if (batchErr) continue`, under a comment reading "error ⇒ not
-- payable / migration not applied ⇒ the batch stays for the human". So the failure looked like a
-- normal outcome, every run, forever. Multi-invoice auto-confirmation had never booked anything —
-- and no test could see it, because every test of that path stops at the pure planner.
