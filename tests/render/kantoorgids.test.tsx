// [KANTOORGIDS] Do the two directory screens render, and do they say the true thing on each branch?
//
// Run: npm run test:render
//
// ── WHY THESE TWO ──
// The public gids is read by an owner who does not have an account yet, and the panel is written
// for the accountant this product is sold through. Both are pure-props-and-state components once
// the data is in, and both have branches that are invisible to tsc: an EMPTY list, an UNREADABLE
// list, a listing that is on and one that is off. The empty and the unreadable branch render the
// same shape and mean opposite things — "niemand staat erin" versus "wij konden het niet lezen" —
// and getting them the wrong way round tells an office that the gids is deserted when it is not.
//
// The public page is an async server component that reads Supabase, so it is exercised through its
// pure parts instead: the module the page renders from. What is asserted here about the page
// itself is what a reader must never see — a paid position, or a promise of offices to come.
