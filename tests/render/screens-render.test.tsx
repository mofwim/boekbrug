// [WIT-SCHERM] Every dashboard screen must survive being CALLED, not merely compiled.
//
// Run: npm run test:render
//
// ── THE HOLE THIS CLOSES ──
// The render gate existed, and it covered the four money screens. Measured across the rest:
// fifteen client screens — 5.317 lines, including /dashboard/upload, the door every document in
// this app comes through — were never called by any test. A screen that throws on every render
// passes tsc, eslint, next build and the Playwright smoke sweep, because none of those call a
// component and the smoke test never logs in (see money-screens.test.tsx for the case that proved
// it). So fifteen screens could have been white pages and every gate would have been green.
//
// That is not an abstract risk here. The owner demonstrates this app to accountants, on his own
// laptop, with no developer in the room. A screen that breaks during that meeting ends the meeting.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ──
// It asserts each screen RUNS and produces markup. It is not a UI test: not how a screen looks, not
// what a click does. Behaviour lives in the pure modules with their own tests. This covers the one
// thing those cannot see — whether the screen that uses them survives being called.
//
// A screen that fetches its own rows can only be seen in its EMPTY state from here, and that limit
// is stated rather than hidden: renderToStaticMarkup runs no effects, so nothing reaches a network.
// Where a screen takes its rows as props, this file hands it rows that exercise the branches —
// [RENDER-GATE]'s own rule, because `[].filter(cb)` never calls `cb` and the bug hides in `cb`.
//
// The companion gate [WIT-SCHERM] in lifecycle-gates.test.ts holds the list closed: a new client
// screen with no render here turns it red.
