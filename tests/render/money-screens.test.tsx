// [RENDER-GATE] Do the money screens survive one render?
//
// Run: npm run test:render
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──
// The five gates this repo runs are all blind to a crashing screen.
//
//   · `tsc --noEmit` type-checks, and a temporal-dead-zone reference inside a `.filter()` callback
//     is perfectly typed — TypeScript does not model WHEN a closure runs.
//   · `eslint src/` has no rule for it (no-use-before-define fires on 32 places in this repo,
//     almost all of them the harmless kind: a module-scope const used inside a function that runs
//     later). Turning it on would drown the real one in noise.
//   · `next build` compiles the component. It does not call it.
//   · The Playwright smoke test sweeps the PUBLIC surface — every path the middleware lets through
//     without a session. /dashboard/* is by definition not on it.
//
// So a logged-in screen that throws on EVERY render passes all five. That is not hypothetical:
// [INVOICE-SCAN] shipped through the whole gate set with `displayed` reading `onlyFlagged` seventy
// lines before it was declared. Five green gates, and the pay screen would have been a white page
// with "Cannot access 'onlyFlagged' before initialization" in the console.
//
// One render is enough to catch that entire class, and it costs under a second.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS NOT ──
// Not a UI test. It asserts that the component RUNS and that its output is not empty — not how it
// looks, not what it does when you click. Behaviour lives in the pure modules, which have their own
// tests; this gate covers the one thing those cannot see, which is whether the screen that uses
// them survives being called.
//
// ── WHY react-dom/server AND NOT PLAYWRIGHT ──
// Playwright would need a real session, a database with rows in a known state, and a served build.
// This needs none of that: the components take their data as props, so we hand them rows and call
// them. Effects never run under renderToStaticMarkup, so nothing reaches the network.
//
// ── WHY IT LIVES IN tests/render/ AND NOT IN tests/ ──
// playwright.config.ts has testDir './tests'. Its testMatch is pinned to *.spec.ts precisely so
// this file is not picked up by a runner that would not understand it.

// DELIBERATELY FAKE, and set here rather than in the npm script so the gate runs the same way on

// Supabase client library refuses to be CONSTRUCTED without a URL and a key, and these screens
// construct one while rendering. The host does not exist, which is exactly right — effects never
// run under renderToStaticMarkup, so nothing here may reach a network, and if a render ever starts

 *     the form still renders with the new branch in it, not that the branch renders.
 *  2. /dashboard/settings is deliberately NOT on the list, even though the exemption declaration
 *     lives there. Its entire body sits behind a `loading` flag that only an effect can clear, so
 *     one render returns a 123-character "Laden..." and nothing else. Listing it would add a test
 *     that passes without ever reaching the code it claims to cover — the precise false green this
 *     file exists to prevent.
 *
 * Both are the same structural boundary: this gate calls components, it does not run their
